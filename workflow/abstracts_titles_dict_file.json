METHOD: Single observational case report in urban USA. CASE PRESENTATION: An alcoholic patient with pancreatitis, chronic diarrhea, and vitamin A deficiency presented with a marginal corneal ulcer from which two bacteria of the family Micrococcaceae were cultured and identified by genome sequence analysis, namely Kocuria palustris and Rothia mucilaginosa. Soon after, severe bilateral peripheral ulcerative keratitis developed, later accompanied by eyelid cellulitis of one lid. These conditions improved with antibiotics, treatment of the underlying gastrointestinal conditions, and treatment of the vitamin deficiency. CONCLUSION: Susceptibility to keratitis with unusual bacteria of the Micrococcaceae family can occur in the setting of alcoholism-related gastrointestinal disease with severe vitamin A deficiency. To our knowledge, K. palustris is a species not previously identified in any human disease, and the Kocuria genus has not previously been reported as a participant in eye infection. Documented cases of R. mucilaginosa in ocular disease are rare. These unusual infections heralded the onset of severe marginal corneal melts."

    "abstract4":"BACKGROUND: Group B streptococcus (GBS), which asymptomatically colonises the vaginal and rectal areas of women, is the leading cause of septicemia, meningitis and pneumonia in neonates. In Tanzania no studies have been done on GBS colonisation of pregnant women and neonates. This study was conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania to determine the prevalence of GBS colonisation among pregnant women, the neonatal colonisation rate and the antimicrobial susceptibility, thus providing essential information to formulate a policy for treatment and prevention regarding perinatal GBS diseases. METHODS: This cross sectional study involved 300 pregnant women attending antenatal clinic and their newborns delivered at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) between October 2008 and March 2009. High vaginal, rectal, nasal, ear and umbilical swabs were cultured on Todd Hewitt Broth and in 5% sheep blood agar followed by identification of isolates using conventional methods and testing for their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents using the Kirby-Bauer method. RESULTS: GBS colonisation was confirmed in 23% of pregnant women and 8.9% of neonates. A higher proportion of GBS were isolated from the vagina (12.3%) as compared to the rectum (5%). Prolonged duration of labour (>12 hrs) was significantly shown to influence GBS colonisation in neonates P < 0.05. Other risk factors such as prolonged rupture of membrane, intrapartum fever, low birth weight and HIV infection did not correlate with GBS colonisation. All isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and ampicillin. Resistance to clindamycin, erythromycin and penicillin G was found to 17.6%, 13% and 9.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings seem to suggest that a quarter of pregnant women attending ANC clinic at MNH and approximately 10% of their newborns are colonised with GBS. All isolates were found to be sensitive to vancomycin and ampicillin which seem to be the most effective antibiotics for the time being. However there is a need for continuous antibiotics surveillance of GBS to monitor trend of resistance. The high isolation frequency of GBS among pregnant women suggests routine antenatal screening at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation in order to provide antibiotic prophylaxis to GBS carrier."

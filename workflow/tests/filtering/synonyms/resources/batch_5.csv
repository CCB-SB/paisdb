Out of thirty cases of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis seen at a single tertiary referral center, only two cases of co-infection with NMDAR encephalitis were identified.

1,"Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis (anti-NMDARe) was originally described as a paraneoplastic disease with more than 50% cases involving a tumor. However, tumor incidence in anti-NMDARe in children is much lower. Herpes simplex virus-induced anti-NMDARe has been well-described; however, findings on Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)-induced anti-NMDARe are scarce. Here, we describe a 7-year-old boy who presented with fever and headache that progressed to seizures and disturbance of consciousness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed abnormalities in the bilateral globus pallidus. The diagnosis of JE was made based on a positive JE antibody test results in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Antiviral and symptomatic therapies led to rapid recovery. Four weeks after the onset of JE, the patient presented with emotional and behavioral disturbances, sleep difficulty, and extrapyramidal symptoms. MRI showed symmetrical lesions in the bilateral thalami and basal ganglia which were expanded than those on the original scan. Antibodies against NMDAR were detected and immunotherapy led to significant recovery. This case and our literature review suggest that JEV may be a clinically important cause of anti-NMDARe in children. Patients with JE-induced anti-NMDARe present with symptoms similar to those of patients with primary anti-NMDARe.

2,"BACKGROUND: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis is an important type of brain inflammation caused by autoantibody. As one of the primary agents responsible for respiratory tract infection, the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) has also been reported to be capable of causing extrapulmonary diseases. Here, we first describe a case of anti-NMDAR encephalitis when hRSV was shown to be present in the cerebrospinal fluid. CASE PRESENTATION: The child was noted to have ataxia and positive anti-NMDA receptors in the cerebrospinal fluid, diagnosed as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in combination with cranial MRI images. After high-dose hormone pulse therapy and medication, the disease improved, and he was discharged. However, a relapse occurred almost a year later, and the cranial MRI imaging showed progressive cerebellar atrophy. An hRSV strain from group B was detected in his cerebrospinal fluid, and the whole genome sequence was recovered using transcriptome sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of hRSV being found in the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

3,"Changes in the intestinal microbiota have been observed in patients with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARE). However, whether and how the intestinal microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis of NMDARE susceptibility needs to be demonstrated. Here, we first showed that germ-free (GF) mice that underwent fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from NMDARE patients, whose fecal microbiota exhibited low short-chain fatty acid content, decreased abundance of Lachnospiraceae, and increased abundance of Verrucomicrobiota, Akkermansia, Parabacteroides, Oscillospirales, showed significant behavioral deficits. Then, these FMT mice were actively immunized with an amino terminal domain peptide from the GluN1 subunit (GluN1356-385) to mimic the pathogenic process of NMDARE. We found that FMT mice showed an increased susceptibility to an encephalitis-like phenotype characterized by more clinical symptoms, greater pentazole (PTZ)-induced susceptibility to seizures, and higher levels of T2 weighted image (T2WI) hyperintensities following immunization. Furthermore, mice with dysbiotic microbiota had impaired blood-brain barrier integrity and a proinflammatory condition. In NMDARE-microbiota recipient mice, the levels of Evan's blue (EB) dye extravasation increased, ZO-1 and claudin-5 expression decreased, and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, TNF-alpha and LPS) increased. Finally, significant brain inflammation, mainly in hippocampal and cortical regions, with modest neuroinflammation, immune cell infiltration, and reduced expression of NMDA receptors were observed in NMDARE microbiota recipient mice following immunization.

4,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the diversity and composition of the fecal microbiota in patients with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis. METHODS: We enrolled 10 patients in the acute stage with naive treatment, seven patients with relapse, 13 patients without relapse in the remission phase, and 12 paired healthy controls. The fecal microbiota in different groups was compared by 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Prominent dysbiosis in the gut microbiome of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis was found. Our primary findings showed that the overall species richness (alpha diversity indexes) of the microbiota was higher in patients than in controls (P < 0.05). Distance-based community analysis revealed that the microbiota differed substantially within all subgroups of patients and controls (P < 0.05). The relative abundance of species heatmap showed a tendency toward depletion for some commensal genera, such as Prevotella_6, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and other short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria. Additionally, our results showed that all subgroups had a distinct bacterial species, with an increase in the genus Fusobacterium in the acute phase group and the genera Streptococcus and Parabacteroides in patients with relapse. However, the genus Bacteroides was very abundant in patients without relapse.

7,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive cutaneous neuroendocrine cancer with a high risk of recurrence and metastasis. MCC is generally associated with advanced age, fair skin, sun exposure, immunosuppression, and in the majority of cases, the Merkel cell polyomavirus. Neuroendocrine malignancies are associated with a variety of paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS), characterized as autoimmune responses to malignancy-associated expression of neural antigens. Our literature review underscores previous case reports of MCC-associated PNS with voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) and anti-Hu (or ANNA-1) autoantibodies. We present the case of a 59-year-old male with regionally metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma complicated by the paraneoplastic manifestation of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis. His primary lower neck subcutaneous MCC and metastasis were initially treated with surgery. Additional recurrent lymph node metastases were successfully treated with definitive intensity-modulated radiation therapy. His PNS improved with rituximab therapy. Although rare, this case highlights that in the setting of seizures and prominent psychiatric symptoms accompanying an MCC diagnosis, evaluation for autoimmune paraneoplastic encephalitis is warranted. Awareness and detection of preexisting PNS are crucial in the era of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) for advanced MCC, where treatment with ICI has the potential to exacerbate preexisting autoimmune PNS and lead to worsened or even lethal neurologic immune-related adverse events (nirAEs).",Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis,Polyomavirus sp.,"Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis,Polyomavirus sp.","""Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis""[TIAB] AND (""Polyomavirus sp.""[TIAB] OR ""Polyomavirus""[TIAB] OR ""Polyomaviruses""[TIAB]) AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",33062358,10.1155/2020/1257587,Regionally Metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma Associated with Paraneoplastic,Case reports in oncological medicine,2020/10/17,,,['Case Reports'],2020
8,"BACKGROUND: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is a type of autoimmune encephalitis. The underlying mechanism(s) remain largely unknown. Recent evidence has indicated that the gut microbiome may be involved in neurological immune diseases via the ""gut-brain axis"". This study aimed to explore the possible relationship between anti-NMDAR encephalitis and the gut microbiome. METHODS: Fecal specimens were collected from 10 patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and 10 healthy volunteers. The microbiome analysis was based on Illumina sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. The alpha, beta, and taxonomic diversity analyses were mainly based on the QIIME2 pipeline. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences in epidemiology, medication, and clinical characteristics (except for those related to anti-NMDAR encephalitis) between the two groups. ASV analysis showed that Prevotella was significantly increased, while Bacteroides was reduced in the gut microbiota of the patients, compared with the controls. Alpha diversity results showed a decrease in diversity in the patients compared with the healthy controls, analyzed by the Shannon diversity, Simpson diversity, and Pielou_E uniformity based on the Kruskal-Wallis test (P = 0.0342, 0.0040, and 0.0002, respectively). Beta diversity analysis showed that the abundance and composition of the gut microbiota was significantly different between the two groups, analyzed by weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance (P = 0.005 and 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The abundance and evenness of bacterial distribution were significantly lower and jeopardized in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis than in healthy controls.

18,"BACKGROUND: To describe the national Danish N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARE) cohort. METHODS: All NMDAR immunoglobulin G (IgG) positive cases in Denmark from 2009 to 2019 were included. Medical information was assessed retrospectively for clinical phenotype, workup, treatment and outcome. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were NMDAR IgG positive in serum/CSF. Fifty-five fulfilled the criteria of NMDARE, 18 did not and 4 had missing data. Incidence was 0.17/100,000 persons per year in 2018, and incidence rates increased since 2009. Of the 55 NMDARE patients (median age 27; 60% female), 9 had post-herpes simplex (HSE) NMDARE and 7 had a tumor (four teratomas). MRI was normal in 51% of patients. Brain FDG PET was performed in 17 patients, and was abnormal in 47% of patients with a normal MRI. First-line therapy was administered to 91%, and 24% required second-line therapy. Maintenance therapy during recovery was given 84% of patients, with no effect on relapse-risk. ICU admission occurred in 29%. Poor outcome (mRS > 2) was reported in 27% and dependent on age and etiology. Patients > 45 years had a poorer outcome (71% vs 8%, p < 0.0001), more frequently post-HSE NMDARE (47% vs 3%, p < 0.0001) and underlying malignancies (18% vs 0%). CONCLUSION: The incidence of NMDARE in Denmark is currently 0.17/100,000 persons per year, and has increased since 2009. NMDARE patients in Denmark display a higher median age, lower female:male ratio, a less frequent tumor association and need for ICU admission. Maintenance therapy did not reduce relapse rate.

METHODS: We describe our experience with 13 patients (median age, 7 years; range, 5 months to 19 years) presenting to tertiary referral centers in India and the United States. RESULTS: Initial manifestations were neurological (seizures or movement disorders) in eight patients, and psychiatric (e.g., emotional lability and hallucination) in five patients. Symptoms during the clinical course included seizures in ten patients, movement disorders (dyskinesia and choreiform movements) in 11 patients, and behavioral changes (aggressiveness and insomnia) in ten patients. Concomitant infections (herpes simplex virus 1, tuberculous meningitis, and influenza A) were present in three patients. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid in all except two cases preceded by infection (herpes simplex virus encephalitis and tuberculous meningitis) was unremarkable. Treatment included intravenous immunoglobulin/methylprednisolone (11 patients), rituximab (eight patients), plasmapheresis (two patients), and cyclophosphamide (two patients). Six patients recovered completely. Two patients had mild residual neurological deficits, whereas four had severe residual neurological deficits. Two patients had profound autonomic instability, which was the cause of death for one of them. Two patients relapsed at two and six months after the initial recovery.

23,"AIM: We describe a child with severe generalized choreoathetosis and anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis after herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis. Recent evidence supports an autoimmune trigger for anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis following a viral infection. This is emerging as a common and potentially treatable autoimmune condition in the pediatric population. PATIENT DESCRIPTION: A 6-month-old girl presented with fever, diarrhea, and partial seizures and was subsequently treated for proven herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis. Shortly thereafter, she developed irritability, insomnia, dysautonomia, orolingual and facial choreodystonic movements, spontaneous vocalizations, and choreoathetoid movements of her trunk and limbs. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis confirmed anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antibodies. Management of her movements required titrated doses of clobazam, valproate, tetrabenazine, and immunotherapy. At 3 months' follow-up, her abnormal movements had completely resolved. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient adds to recent evidence linking a viral trigger for brain autoimmunity. Movement disorders appear early, leading to severe patient and family distress, and pose a serious management dilemma because of a paucity of clinical trials assessing treatments in the pediatric population.

27,"Anti N-methyl D-aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDAR-E) though rare, is currently considered as the commonest antibody mediated encephalitis in the world. No review on perspectives of NMDAR-E from India is available. The aim of the study was to review all the cases of NMDAR-E reported from India until June 2021 in terms of clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment, and perform a comparison of adult and paediatric cases. A literature review of NMDAR-E case reports/case series published from India till June 2021 was done. Demography, clinical profile, triggers, electroencephalography (EEG), neuroimaging, treatment details and outcomes were analysed. Sixteen case series and 35 case reports with a total of 249 cases were analysed. 82% of cases were from paediatric age group. The female to male ratio was 3:1. Psychiatric deficits, movement disorders, seizures, and language abnormalities were the most common clinical features. MRI brain abnormalities were seen in 45% patients. Electroencephalographic abnormalities were seen in 85% of patients. Infective triggers (herpes simplex virus and various other agents) were reported in 11% of the cases. Pediatric patients as compared with adults had more encephalopathy, autonomic dysfunctions, and normal imaging whereas the latter had more cognitive dysfunctions and delta brush pattern in electroencephalography (p<0.005). Therefore, to conclude, this literature review suggests that overall, the clinical spectrum of Indian cases is like cases described from other parts of the world. However, most reported cases from India belonged to paediatric age group who had more encephalopathy, autonomic dysfunctions, and normal brain imaging compared to adults.

28,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARE) is the most common form of autoimmune encephalitis in children and adults. Although our understanding of the disease mechanisms has progressed, little is known about estimating patient outcomes. Therefore, the NEOS (anti-NMDAR Encephalitis One-Year Functional Status) score was introduced as a tool to predict disease progression in NMDARE. Developed in a mixed-age cohort, it currently remains unclear whether NEOS can be optimized for pediatric NMDARE. METHODS: This retrospective observational study aimed to validate NEOS in a large pediatric-only cohort of 59 patients (median age of 8 years). We reconstructed the original score, adapted it, evaluated additional variables, and assessed its predictive power (median follow-up of 20 months). Generalized linear regression models were used to examine predictability of binary outcomes based on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). In addition, neuropsychological test results were investigated as alternative cognitive outcome. RESULTS: The NEOS score reliably predicted poor clinical outcome (mRS >/=3) in children in the first year after diagnosis (p = 0.0014) and beyond (p = 0.036, 16 months after diagnosis). A score adapted to the pediatric cohort by adjusting the cutoffs of the 5 NEOS components did not improve predictive power. In addition to these 5 variables, further patient characteristics such as the ""Herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSE) status"" and ""age at disease onset"" influenced predictability and could potentially be useful to define risk groups. NEOS also predicted cognitive outcome with higher scores associated with deficits of executive function (p = 0.048) and memory (p = 0.043). DISCUSSION: Our data support the applicability of the NEOS score in children with NMDARE. Although not yet validated in prospective studies, NEOS also predicted cognitive impairment in our cohort. Consequently, the score could help identify patients at risk of poor overall clinical outcome and poor cognitive outcome and thus aid in selecting not only optimized initial therapies for these patients but also cognitive rehabilitation to improve long-term outcomes.",Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis,Simplexvirus humanalpha2,"Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis,Simplexvirus humanalpha2","""Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis""[TIAB] AND (""Simplexvirus humanalpha2""[TIAB] OR ""Herpes simplex virus type 2 ""[TIAB] OR ""Herpes simplex virus type 2""[TIAB] OR ""Herpes simplex virus 2""[TIAB] OR ""Herpes simplex virus ""[TIAB] OR ""Herpes simplex virus II""[TIAB] OR ""Human herpesvirus 2""[TIAB] OR ""herpes simplex virus type 2 HSV-2""[TIAB]) AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",36948591,10.1212/NXI.0000000000200102,Retrospective Pediatric Cohort Study Validates NEOS Score and Demonstrates,Neurology(R) neuroimmunology & neuroinflammation,2023/03/23,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Humans', '*Anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor Encephalitis/drug therapy', 'Cohort Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Prospective Studies', '*Encephalitis, Herpes Simplex/complications', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate']","0 (Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate)","['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",2023
29,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can help to distinguish early stage autoimmune (AI) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitides. METHODS: This case-control study included patients from a multi-center cohort of AI encephalitides whose initial MRI including DWI was performed within ten days after symptoms onset. They were compared with patients with HSV encephalitis enrolled prospectively in a single-center from June, 2020 to December, 2020. The final diagnosis of AI encephalitis required a positive autoantibody assay, and that of HSV encephalitis required a positive HSV polymerase chain reaction based on cerebrospinal fluid. Brain MRI were evaluated for restricted diffusion, fluid-inversion recovery (FLAIR) abnormalities, lesion topography, hemorrhagic changes, and contrast enhancement. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were included of which, 19 (38.8%) had AI encephalitis. Twenty-seven patients (55.1%) were males and the median age was 46.0 years (interquartile range (IQR):[22.0; 65.0]). Brain MRI were performed after a median of 4 days (IQR:[2.0; 7.0]) of symptom onset and time between symptom onset and MRI was not significantly different (p = 0.60). Twenty-six patients had restricted diffusion lesions in the medial temporal lobe, including 25/30 in the HSV encephalitis group (p < 0.001). FLAIR abnormalities were observed in 36 patients, including 29/30 in the HSV encephalitis group (p < 0.001). Lesion topography, hemorrhagic changes, and contrast enhancement did not differ significantly between the two groups.

30,"Neonatal herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSVE) often results in long-lasting neuro-disability in affected children. In addition to primary HSVE and HSVE relapses, children with herpes simplex virus are at increased risk of developing anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARe), an autoimmune encephalitis. In this study, we describe a patient with neonatal disseminated herpes infection, who developed HSVE after discontinuation of 2 years of acyclovir suppressive therapy. After resolution of HSVE, the patient rapidly deteriorated with significant behavioral and neurologic changes including emotional outbursts, fearfulness, involuntary movements, and focal seizures. The patient was diagnosed with anti-NMDARe and was later found to have low toll-like receptor-3 function. In this study, we review published pediatric cases of anti-NMDARe after HSVE as well as previous literature and primary data examining the presentation, predisposing risk factors, predictive outcomes, future directions, and the role of immunodeficiency in HSVE-mediated anti-NMDARe. The neonatal immune system and developing brain are disproportionately vulnerable to early viral exposure; therefore, it is important to recognize the value of early immunodeficiency screening in patients with neonatal herpes simplex virus. By understanding the immune landscape within this patient population, we can mitigate long-term neurologic disability and improve the quality of life of affected children.",Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis,Simplexvirus humanalpha2,"Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis,Simplexvirus humanalpha2","""Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis""[TIAB] AND (""Simplexvirus humanalpha2""[TIAB] OR ""Herpes simplex virus type 2 ""[TIAB] OR ""Herpes simplex virus type 2""[TIAB] OR ""Herpes simplex virus 2""[TIAB] OR ""Herpes simplex virus ""[TIAB] OR ""Herpes simplex virus II""[TIAB] OR ""Human herpesvirus 2""[TIAB] OR ""herpes simplex virus type 2 HSV-2""[TIAB]) AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",34385350,10.1542/peds.2020-035824,Anti-NMDAR Encephalitis After Neonatal HSV-1 Infection in a Child With Low TLR-3,Pediatrics,2021/08/14,"['Acyclovir/*therapeutic use', 'Anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor Encephalitis/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Herpes Simplex/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/virology']",0 (Antiviral Agents),"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",2021
31,"BACKGROUND: To describe the national Danish N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARE) cohort. METHODS: All NMDAR immunoglobulin G (IgG) positive cases in Denmark from 2009 to 2019 were included. Medical information was assessed retrospectively for clinical phenotype, workup, treatment and outcome. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were NMDAR IgG positive in serum/CSF. Fifty-five fulfilled the criteria of NMDARE, 18 did not and 4 had missing data. Incidence was 0.17/100,000 persons per year in 2018, and incidence rates increased since 2009. Of the 55 NMDARE patients (median age 27; 60% female), 9 had post-herpes simplex (HSE) NMDARE and 7 had a tumor (four teratomas). MRI was normal in 51% of patients. Brain FDG PET was performed in 17 patients, and was abnormal in 47% of patients with a normal MRI. First-line therapy was administered to 91%, and 24% required second-line therapy. Maintenance therapy during recovery was given 84% of patients, with no effect on relapse-risk. ICU admission occurred in 29%. Poor outcome (mRS > 2) was reported in 27% and dependent on age and etiology. Patients > 45 years had a poorer outcome (71% vs 8%, p < 0.0001), more frequently post-HSE NMDARE (47% vs 3%, p < 0.0001) and underlying malignancies (18% vs 0%). CONCLUSION: The incidence of NMDARE in Denmark is currently 0.17/100,000 persons per year, and has increased since 2009. NMDARE patients in Denmark display a higher median age, lower female:male ratio, a less frequent tumor association and need for ICU admission. Maintenance therapy did not reduce relapse rate.

METHODS: We prospectively identified children (</=14 years of age) admitted with suspected encephalitis at 5 major pediatric hospitals nationally between May 2013 and December 2016 using the Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) Network. A multidisciplinary expert panel reviewed cases and categorized them using published definitions. Confirmed encephalitis cases were categorized into etiologic subgroups. RESULTS: From 526 cases of suspected encephalitis, 287 children met criteria for confirmed encephalitis: 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52%-63%) had infectious causes, 10% enterovirus, 10% parechovirus, 8% bacterial meningoencephalitis, 6% influenza, 6% herpes simplex virus (HSV), and 6% Mycoplasma pneumoniae; 25% (95% CI, 20%-30%) had immune-mediated encephalitis, 18% acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and 6% anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis; and 17% (95% CI, 13%-21%) had an unknown cause.

38,"Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis (anti-NMDARe) was originally described as a paraneoplastic disease with more than 50% cases involving a tumor. However, tumor incidence in anti-NMDARe in children is much lower. Herpes simplex virus-induced anti-NMDARe has been well-described; however, findings on Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)-induced anti-NMDARe are scarce. Here, we describe a 7-year-old boy who presented with fever and headache that progressed to seizures and disturbance of consciousness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed abnormalities in the bilateral globus pallidus. The diagnosis of JE was made based on a positive JE antibody test results in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Antiviral and symptomatic therapies led to rapid recovery. Four weeks after the onset of JE, the patient presented with emotional and behavioral disturbances, sleep difficulty, and extrapyramidal symptoms. MRI showed symmetrical lesions in the bilateral thalami and basal ganglia which were expanded than those on the original scan. Antibodies against NMDAR were detected and immunotherapy led to significant recovery.

39,"AIM: The study aims to analyze the incidence, clinical features, investigation findings and treatment outcomes of anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis in children from Hong Kong. METHOD: A retrospective study was carried out on paediatric patients diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis in Hong Kong from January 2009 to December 2015. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (67% female, 93% Chinese) were identified over seven years and the estimated incidence in Hong Kong was 2.2/million children per year (95% CI 1.2-3.6). The median age of presentation was 12 years (range 1-17 years). The most common symptom groups observed were abnormal psychiatric behavior or cognitive dysfunction (14/15, 93%) and seizures (14/15, 93%), followed by speech dysfunction (13/15, 87%), movement disorders (12/15, 80%), decreased level of consciousness (10/15, 67%) and autonomic dysfunction or central hypoventilation (5/15, 33%). The median number of symptom groups developed in each patient was 5 (range 3-6). All patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and/or steroids. Three patients (20%) with more severe presentation required additional plasmapheresis and rituximab. Outcome was assessable in 14 patients. Among those eleven patients who had only received intravenous immunoglobulin and/or steroids, nine patients (82%) achieved full recovery. One patient (9%) had residual behavioral problem, while another one (9%) who developed anti-NMDAR encephalitis after herpes simplex virus encephalitis was complicated with dyskinetic cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Among those three patients who required plasmapheresis and rituximab, one (33%) had full recovery and two (66%) had substantial recovery. The median duration of follow up was 20.5 months (range 3-84 months). CONCLUSION: Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is an acquired, severe, but potentially treatable disorder. Ethnicity may play a role in the incidence of anti-NMDAR encephalitis and we have provided a local incidence with the majority of patients being Chinese. The diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis should be considered in children presenting with a constellation of symptoms including psychiatric and neurological manifestations.

41,"OBJECTIVE: There is a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in children with anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibody encephalitis from two different health care settings. METHODS: We describe our experience with 13 patients (median age, 7 years; range, 5 months to 19 years) presenting to tertiary referral centers in India and the United States. RESULTS: Initial manifestations were neurological (seizures or movement disorders) in eight patients, and psychiatric (e.g., emotional lability and hallucination) in five patients. Symptoms during the clinical course included seizures in ten patients, movement disorders (dyskinesia and choreiform movements) in 11 patients, and behavioral changes (aggressiveness and insomnia) in ten patients. Concomitant infections (herpes simplex virus 1, tuberculous meningitis, and influenza A) were present in three patients. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid in all except two cases preceded by infection (herpes simplex virus encephalitis and tuberculous meningitis) was unremarkable. Treatment included intravenous immunoglobulin/methylprednisolone (11 patients), rituximab (eight patients), plasmapheresis (two patients), and cyclophosphamide (two patients). Six patients recovered completely. Two patients had mild residual neurological deficits, whereas four had severe residual neurological deficits. Two patients had profound autonomic instability, which was the cause of death for one of them. Two patients relapsed at two and six months after the initial recovery.

42,"AIM: To examine the cytokine/chemokine profile of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during acute herpes simplex virus-induced N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) autoimmunity and in chronic/relapsing post-herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSE) neurological syndromes. METHOD: We measured longitudinal serial CSF cyto-/chemokines (n=34) and a glial marker (calcium-binding astroglial protein, S100B) in one patient during acute HSE and subsequent anti-NMDAR encephalitis, and compared the results with those from two patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis without preceding HSE. We also compared cyto-/chemokines in cross-sectional CSF samples from three children with previous HSE who had ongoing chronic or relapsing neurological symptoms (2yr 9 mo-16y after HSE) with those in a group of children having non-inflammatory neurological conditions (n=20). RESULTS: Acute HSE showed elevation of a broad range of all T-helper-subset-related cyto-/chemokines and S100B whereas the post-HSE anti-NMDAR encephalitis phase showed persistent elevation of two of five T-helper-1 (chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand 9 [CXCL9], CXCL10), three of five predominantly B-cell (CXCL13, CCL19, a proliferation-inducing ligand [APRIL])-mediated cyto-/chemokines, and interferon-alpha. The post-HSE anti-NMDAR encephalitis inflammatory response was more pronounced than anti-NMDAR encephalitis. All three chronic post-HSE cases showed persistent elevation of CXCL9, CXCL10, and interferon-alpha, and there was histopathological evidence of chronic lymphocytic inflammation in one biopsied case 7 years after HSE. Two of three chronic cases showed a modest response to immune therapy. INTERPRETATION: HSE-induced anti-NMDAR encephalitis is a complex and pronounced inflammatory syndrome. There is persistent CSF upregulation of cyto-/chemokines in chronic or relapsing post-HSE neurological symptoms, which may be modifiable with immune therapy.

43,"AIM: To conduct a systematic literature review on patients with biphasic disease with herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis followed by anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis. METHOD: We conducted a case report and systematic literature review (up to 10 December 2016), focused on differences between herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) and anti-NMDAR encephalitis phases, age-related characteristics of HSV-induced anti-NMDAR encephalitis, and therapy. For statistical analyses, McNemar's test, Fisher's test, and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used (two-tailed significance level set at 5%). RESULTS: Forty-three patients with biphasic disease were identified (31 children). Latency between HSE and anti-NMDAR encephalitis was significantly shorter in children than adults (median 24 vs 40.5d; p=0.006). Compared with HSE, anti-NMDAR encephalitis was characterized by significantly higher frequency of movement disorder (2.5% vs 75% respectively; p<0.001), and significantly lower rate of seizures (70% vs 30% respectively; p=0.001). Compared with adults, during anti-NMDAR encephalitis children had significantly more movement disorders (86.7% children vs 40% adults; p=0.006), fewer psychiatric symptoms (41.9% children vs 90.0% adults; p=0.025), and a slightly higher median modified Rankin Scale score (5 in children vs 4 in adults; p=0.015). During anti-NMDAR encephalitis, 84.6 per cent of patients received aciclovir (for </=7d in 22.7%; long-term antivirals in 18.0% only), and 92.7 per cent immune therapy, but none had recurrence of HSE clinically or using cerebrospinal fluid HSV polymerase chain reaction (median follow-up 7mo). INTERPRETATION: Our review suggests that movement disorder may help differentiate clinically an episode of HSV-induced anti-NMDAR encephalitis from HSE relapse. Compared with adults, children have shorter latency between HSE and anti-NMDAR encephalitis and, during anti-NMDAR encephalitis, more movement disorder, fewer psychiatric symptoms, and slightly more severe disease.

44,"INTRODUCTION: Morbidity and mortality of Herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSE) remain high. Relapses of neurological signs may occur after initial clinical improvement under acyclovir treatment. METHODS: We report here a case of post-HSE anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-mediated encephalitis in an adult and perform a systematic search on PubMed to identify other cases in adults. RESULTS: We identified 11 previously published cases, to discuss diagnostic and therapeutic management. Symptoms in adults are often inappropriate behaviors, confusion and agitation. Diagnosis of anti-NMDA-R encephalitis after HSE is often delayed. Treatment consists in steroids, plasma exchange, and rituximab. Prognosis is often favorable.

46,"Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), which is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), is a severe neuro-infectious disease characterized by high mortality and morbidity. We reviewed the pathomechanism, diagnosis, and treatment of HSE based on recent progress in the field. The highlighted mechanism of HSE in this review is immune-mediated tissue damage caused by host immunity. Major symptoms of HSE include psychiatric alteration, Kluver-Bucy syndrome, and amnesia, caused by frequent involvement of the limbic system. An important differential diagnosis of HSE is autoimmune limbic encephalitis, including anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis, and anti-voltage-gated K(+) channel encephalitis. HSE is definitely diagnosed based on the detection of HSV-DNA by polymerase chain reaction and/or the detection of HSV-IgG antibody in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Repeated CSF examinations are required for the accurate diagnosis of HSE. Acyclovir (ACV) plays a central role in the treatment of HSE, and its early initiation is essential for good outcome in patients with HSE.

47,"AIM: We describe a child with severe generalized choreoathetosis and anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis after herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis. Recent evidence supports an autoimmune trigger for anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis following a viral infection. This is emerging as a common and potentially treatable autoimmune condition in the pediatric population. PATIENT DESCRIPTION: A 6-month-old girl presented with fever, diarrhea, and partial seizures and was subsequently treated for proven herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis. Shortly thereafter, she developed irritability, insomnia, dysautonomia, orolingual and facial choreodystonic movements, spontaneous vocalizations, and choreoathetoid movements of her trunk and limbs. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis confirmed anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antibodies. Management of her movements required titrated doses of clobazam, valproate, tetrabenazine, and immunotherapy. At 3 months' follow-up, her abnormal movements had completely resolved. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient adds to recent evidence linking a viral trigger for brain autoimmunity. Movement disorders appear early, leading to severe patient and family distress, and pose a serious management dilemma because of a paucity of clinical trials assessing treatments in the pediatric population.

48,"Herpes encephalitis (HE) is among the most common forms of viral encephalitis. Earlier publications indicate the development of acyclovir-refractory choreoathetosis in patients with HE. These reports suggest the development of secondary autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of HE. Combined methylprednisolone and acyclovir treatment reduced the appearance of brain abnormalities relative to treatment with acyclovir alone in a mouse model of encephalitis. We describe a case of a 19-month-old previously healthy girl presenting with sudden onset seizures and loss of consciousness. Initial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for the presence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) were negative as were the tests for the limbic encephalitis antibodies. Steroids were administered with acyclovir to treat suspected autoimmune encephalitis as a result of the patient history of varicella vaccination. HSV PCR testing was positive on the 5th day; however, steroid treatment was continued due to the positive response seen in the patient.

49,"Autoimmune encephalitis is rare and has various clinical manifestations, which may hamper the correct diagnosis. Therefore, the pediatrician should be familiar with the clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory features, neuroimaging changes, immunological characteristics, and differential diagnosis of this disease. In order to correctly diagnose anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations including detection of oligoclonal bands, brain MRI scanning, and routine EEG and/or 24 hours video EEG should be performed in children. For highly suspected cases, particularly children presenting with psychiatric symptoms and epileptic seizures, examinations should be done to detect anti-NMDAR antibodies (Abs) in serum and CSF.

52,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the diversity and composition of the fecal microbiota in patients with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis. METHODS: We enrolled 10 patients in the acute stage with naive treatment, seven patients with relapse, 13 patients without relapse in the remission phase, and 12 paired healthy controls. The fecal microbiota in different groups was compared by 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Prominent dysbiosis in the gut microbiome of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis was found. Our primary findings showed that the overall species richness (alpha diversity indexes) of the microbiota was higher in patients than in controls (P < 0.05). Distance-based community analysis revealed that the microbiota differed substantially within all subgroups of patients and controls (P < 0.05). The relative abundance of species heatmap showed a tendency toward depletion for some commensal genera, such as Prevotella_6, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and other short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria. Additionally, our results showed that all subgroups had a distinct bacterial species, with an increase in the genus Fusobacterium in the acute phase group and the genera Streptococcus and Parabacteroides in patients with relapse. However, the genus Bacteroides was very abundant in patients without relapse. Although the findings regarding the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratios across the four comparison groups were not statistically significant, the F/B ratio gradually increased in patients from the acute phase group (0.87), to the disease remission group with relapse (1.06), to the group without relapse (1.28), to the healthy group (1.63).

60,"Changes in the intestinal microbiota have been observed in patients with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARE). However, whether and how the intestinal microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis of NMDARE susceptibility needs to be demonstrated. Here, we first showed that germ-free (GF) mice that underwent fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from NMDARE patients, whose fecal microbiota exhibited low short-chain fatty acid content, decreased abundance of Lachnospiraceae, and increased abundance of Verrucomicrobiota, Akkermansia, Parabacteroides, Oscillospirales, showed significant behavioral deficits. Then, these FMT mice were actively immunized with an amino terminal domain peptide from the GluN1 subunit (GluN1356-385) to mimic the pathogenic process of NMDARE. We found that FMT mice showed an increased susceptibility to an encephalitis-like phenotype characterized by more clinical symptoms, greater pentazole (PTZ)-induced susceptibility to seizures, and higher levels of T2 weighted image (T2WI) hyperintensities following immunization. Furthermore, mice with dysbiotic microbiota had impaired blood-brain barrier integrity and a proinflammatory condition. In NMDARE-microbiota recipient mice, the levels of Evan's blue (EB) dye extravasation increased, ZO-1 and claudin-5 expression decreased, and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, TNF-alpha and LPS) increased. Finally, significant brain inflammation, mainly in hippocampal and cortical regions, with modest neuroinflammation, immune cell infiltration, and reduced expression of NMDA receptors were observed in NMDARE microbiota recipient mice following immunization.

63,"BACKGROUND: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARe) is capable of presenting a relapsing course and coexisting with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease, whereas it has been relatively rare. We describe a man with no history of tumor who successively developed anti-NMDARe and anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease. CASE SUMMARY: A 29-year-old man was initially admitted with headache, fever, intermittent abnormal behavior, decreased intelligence, limb twitching and loss of consciousness on July 16, 2018. On admission, examination reported no abnormality. During his presentation, he experienced aggravated symptoms, and the re-examination of cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated punctate abnormal signals in the left parietal lobe. External examination of cerebrospinal fluid and serum results revealed serum NMDAR antibody (Ab) (-), cerebrospinal fluid NMDAR-Ab (+) 1:10 and Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen antibody IgG (+). Due to the imaging findings, anti-NMDARe was our primary consideration. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone and gamma globulin pulse therapy, mannitol injection dehydration to reduce intracranial pressure, sodium valproate sustained-release tablets for anti-epilepsy and olanzapine and risperidone to mitigate psychiatric symptoms. The patient was admitted to the hospital for the second time for ""abnormal mental behavior and increased limb movements"" on December 14, 2018. Re-examination of electroencephalography and cranial MRI showed no abnormality. The results of autoimmune encephalitis antibody revealed that serum NMDAR-Ab was weakly positive and cerebrospinal fluid NMDAR-Ab was positive. Considering comprehensive recurrent anti-NMDARe, the patient was treated with propylene-hormone pulse combined with immunosuppressive agents (mycophenolate mofetil), and the symptoms were relieved. The patient was admitted for ""hoarseness and double vision"" for the third time on August 23, 2019. Re-examination of cranial MRI showed abnormal signals in the medulla oblongata and right frontal lobe, and synoptophore examination indicated concomitant esotropia. The patient's visual acuity further decreased, and the re-examination of cranial MRI + enhancement reported multiple scattered speckled and patchy abnormal signals in the medulla oblongata, left pons arm, left cerebellum and right midbrain, thalamus. The patient was diagnosed with an accompanying demyelinating disease. Serum anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 1:10 and NMDAR antibody 1:10 were both positive. The patient was diagnosed with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-related inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system complicated with anti-NMDARe overlap syndrome. The patient was successfully treated with methylprednisolone, gamma globulin pulse therapy and rituximab treatment. The patient remained asymptomatic and follow-up MRI scan 6 mo later showed complete removal of the lesion. CONCLUSION: We emphasize the rarity of this antibody combination and suggest that these patients may require longer follow-up due to the risk of recurrence of two autoimmune disorders.",Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis,human gammaherpesvirus 4,"Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis,human gammaherpesvirus 4","""Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis""[TIAB] AND (""human gammaherpesvirus 4""[TIAB] OR ""Epstein Barr virus""[TIAB] OR ""Epstein-Barr virus""[TIAB] OR ""Human herpesvirus type 4""[TIAB] OR ""Human herpesvirus 4""[TIAB] OR ""Epstein-Barr virus EBV""[TIAB]) AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",35949817,10.12998/wjcc.v10.i18.6148,Overlapping syndrome of recurrent anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis,World journal of clinical cases,2022/08/12,,,['Case Reports'],2022
64,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the clinical characteristics of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in the pediatric nervous system (NS). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data and follow-up results of 89 children with neurological damage caused by EBV who were hospitalized in the children's hospital of Chongqing Medical University from January 2008 to April 2019. RESULTS: EBV infection of the NS can occur at any time of the year. The highest incidence was seen in the age group of 0-4 years. Fever is the main clinical feature (74/89, 83.1%). The main clinical types were encephalitis/meningoencephalitis (64/89, 71.9%), acute myelitis (2/89, 2.2%), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (3/89, 3.4%), Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) (15/89, 16.9%), neurological damage caused by EBV-hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH) (4/89, 4.5%), and NS-post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (NS-PTLD) (1/89, 1.1%). Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis was found during the convalescence of EBV encephalitis. EBV encephalitis/meningitis showed no symptoms of tonsillitis, lymph node enlargement, skin rash, hepatosplenomegaly. Acute motor axonal neuropathy is the chief complication in GBS caused by EBV.

66,"RATIONALE: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is the most frequent autoimmune encephalitis in children, and its presentation is various. The disease can be triggered by various infections. PATIENT CONCERNS: Case 1 was a 7-year-old female with the presentation of seizure, repeated fever, language disorder, and decreased muscle strength of the right limbs; Case 2 was a 7-year-old male with the manifestation of repeated emesis, headache, involuntary movement, altered personality, seizures, and cognitive impairment; Case 3 was a 2-year-old female with repeated fever, emesis, seizures, coma, and decreased muscle strength of limbs. Anti-NMDAR antibody was identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the 3 cases, confirming the diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Pathogenic examinations revealed positive serum Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-nuclear antigen and EBV-capsid antigen (CA)-IgG antibodies in the 3 cases, as well as positive EBV-early antigen (EA)-IgG antibody in CSF. Case 1 also had positive EBV-CA-IgA antibody; Case 3 also had positive EBV-CA-IgA and EBV-CA-IgG antibodies. DIAGNOSES: Anti-NMDAR antibody and EBV-EA-IgG antibody in CSF were tested positive in the 3 cases. Thus, they were diagnosed as anti-NMDAR encephalitis associated with reactivated EBV infection. INTERVENTIONS: All of the 3 cases received immunoglobulin, corticosteroid, and ganciclovir treatment. Cases 2 and 3 also received antiepileptic drugs due to repeated seizures. In addition, Case 3 also received assistant respiration, plasma exchange, and rituximab. OUTCOMES: The 3 cases were substantially recovered after treatment. Repeat CSF analysis showed decreased titer of the anti-NMDAR antibody. LESSONS: Reactivated EBV infection may trigger anti-NMDAR encephalitis in children, which has not been reported previously.

67,"BACKGROUND: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis is an increasingly common autoimmune disorder mediated by antibodies to certain subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. Recent literatures have described anti-thyroid and infectious serology in this encephalitis but without follow-up. CASE PRESENTATION: A 17-year-old Chinese female patient presented with psychiatric symptoms, memory deficits, behavioral problems and seizures. She then progressed through unresponsiveness, dyskinesias, autonomic instability and central hypoventilation during treatment. Her conventional blood work on admission showed high titers of IgG antibodies to thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase and IgM antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus viral capsid antigen. An immature ovarian teratoma was found and removal of the tumor resulted in a full recovery. The final diagnosis of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis was made by the identification of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies in her cerebral spinal fluid. Pathology studies of the teratoma revealed N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 1 positive ectopic immature nervous tissue and Epstein-Barr virus latent infection. She was discharged with symptoms free, but titers of anti-thyroid peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies remained elevated. One year after discharge, her serum remained positive for anti-thyroid peroxidase and anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies, but negative for anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and IgM against Epstein-Barr virus viral capsid antigen. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent high titers of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies from admission to discharge and until one year later in this patient may suggest a propensity to autoimmunity in anti- N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis and support the idea that neuronal and thyroid autoimmunities represent a pathogenic spectrum. Enduring anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies from admission to one year follow-up but seroreversion of Epstein-Barr virus viral capsid antigen IgM may raise the important issue of elucidating the triggers and boosters of anti- N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis.",Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis,human gammaherpesvirus 4,"Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis,human gammaherpesvirus 4","""Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis""[TIAB] AND (""human gammaherpesvirus 4""[TIAB] OR ""Epstein Barr virus""[TIAB] OR ""Epstein-Barr virus""[TIAB] OR ""Human herpesvirus type 4""[TIAB] OR ""Human herpesvirus 4""[TIAB] OR ""Epstein-Barr virus EBV""[TIAB]) AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",22126669,10.1186/1471-2377-11-149,Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis with serum anti-thyroid,BMC neurology,2011/12/01,"['Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Autoantibodies/blood/immunology', 'Autoantigens/immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/immunology/*virology', 'Capsid Proteins/immunology', 'Encephalitis/complications/immunology/*virology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/blood/complications/immunology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood/immunology', 'Iodide Peroxidase/immunology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*complications/immunology/virology', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/*immunology', 'Teratoma/*complications/immunology/virology', 'Thyroglobulin/immunology', 'Young Adult']","0 (Antigens, Viral)","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",2011

The human papillomavirus (HPV) is discussed as a possible causative and influencing factor in development and progression of sinonasal polyposis. This study aims to elucidate HPV frequency in nasal polyps and antrochoanal polyps. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA from 257 tissue specimens (166 nasal polyps, 39 antrochoanal polyps and 52 nasal turbinates) was subjected to three different established HPV- polymerase chain reaction assays, testing for 37 low- and high-risk HPV. In addition, immunohistochemical analyses for HPV16 were carried out, as well as immunohistochemistry and western blots of p16, a biomarker for HPV induced cancer. RESULTS: HPV-DNA was detected in 53.8% of antrochoanal polyps, 15.1% of nasal polyps, and 5.8% of nasal turbinates. HPV16 was the predominant type with a detection rate of 76% in nasal polyps and 62% in antrochoanal polyps. Immunohistochemically, HPV positive tissues stained positive for HPV16 antigens and p16 in epithelial cell layers. No significant p16 overexpression was traceable in antrochoanal polyps, nasal polyps and nasal turbinates by western blot. There was no correlation of HPV-status with sex, age, smoking, alcohol consumption or allergic background. CONCLUSION: The present study shows a significant frequency of high-risk type HPV16 in antrochoanal polyps. Absence of oncogenic transformation or correlation of the HPV-status with clinical data suggests a latent superinfection, possibly because of anatomical proximity to the oropharynx.",Antrochoanal polyps,Human papillomavirus,"Antrochoanal polyps,Human papillomavirus","""Antrochoanal polyps""[TIAB] AND (""Human papillomavirus""[TIAB] OR ""Human Papilloma Virus""[TIAB] OR ""human papillomavirus HPV""[TIAB]) AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",26509801,10.1371/journal.pone.0141722,Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Prevalence in Nasal and Antrochoanal Polyps and,PloS one,2015/10/29,"['Adult', 'Alphapapillomavirus/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasal Mucosa/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Nasal Polyps/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Papillomavirus Infections/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Prevalence', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']","0 (E6 protein, Human papillomavirus type 16)",['Journal Article'],2015
73,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Antrochoanal polyps (ACPs) are benign polypoid lesions arising from the inner wall of the maxillary sinus and extending into the choana. Although the diagnosis and treatment strategies of ACP have changed since this entity was first described, the underlying pathogenic mechanism of APC is poorly understood. This article reviews the current knowledge of the etiology, inflammatory parameters, and microscopic findings of ACP. RECENT FINDINGS: The inflammatory pattern of ACP appears to center around a neutrophilic inflammation T1-dominant endotype. Apart from the inflammatory component of ACP, at the microscopic level, the presence of tissue remodeling, mostly fibrin deposition and edema, and cysts in the epithelium and lamina propria has been described. Although the origin of this T1-dominant endotype immune response of ACPs is not entirely clear, it could be related to a lymphatic obstruction mechanism. This review serves to define a phenotype of ACP with potential endotypes based on the characteristics of the inflammatory parameters, microscopic findings, and hypotheses about the pathogenesis of ACP.",Antrochoanal polyps,Lamina,"Antrochoanal polyps,Lamina","""Antrochoanal polyps""[TIAB] AND ""Lamina""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",36773125,10.1007/s11882-023-01066-1,Pheno-Endotyping Antrochoanal Nasal Polyposis.,Current allergy and asthma reports,2023/02/12,"['Humans', '*Nasal Polyps/etiology', 'Inflammation/pathology', 'Maxillary Sinus/pathology']",,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",2023
74,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESES: This study aimed to investigate the presence of HPV (HPV types 11 and 16) and EBV in antrochoanal polyps and to contribute to the current literature in this regard. STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study. METHODS: A total of 100 patients (including 43 patients undergoing surgery for antrochoanal polyp, 27 patients undergoing surgery for nasal polyp, and 30 patients undergoing surgery for hypertrophic inferior turbinate) were included in this study. DNA was isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples with the aid of the Bioneer's AccuPrep Genomic DNA Extraction Kit. In the obtained genomic DNAs, while the detection of HPV DNA was performed using the nested-PCR method, the detection of HPV types 11/16 and EBV DNA was performed using the RT-PCR method. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients with antrochoanal polyp was 26.7 +/- 15.4 years (range 7-70). There were 20 (46.5%) women and 23 (53.5%) men in the antrochoanal polyp group. HPV DNA was positively detected using the nested-PCR method in 14 (32.6%) of the patients with antrochoanal polyp and in 3 (11.1%) of the patients with nasal polyp. HPV DNA was not detected in the hypertrophic inferior turbinate group (control group). There was a statistically significant difference between all groups in terms of HPV DNA positivity. In the antrochoanal polyp group, 2 patients had HPV 11 positivity and 12 patients had HPV 16 positivity. In the nasal polyp group, 1 patient had HPV 11 positivity and 2 patients had HPV 16 positivity. EBV DNA was positively detected in 16 (37.2%) of the patients with antrochoanal polyp, in 11 (40.7%) of the patients with nasal polyp and in 8 (26.7%) of the patients with hypertrophic inferior turbinate, respectively.

80,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that Staphylococcus aureus secrete superantigenic toxins that play a role in the etiology of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). Twenty S. aureus superantigens (SAg's) have been identified, each of which bind the V beta-region of the T-cell receptor (TCR) outside the peptide-binding site. Approximately 50 distinct V beta-domains exist in the human repertoire, and distinct SAg's will bind only particular domains generating a pattern of V beta-enrichment in lymphocytes dependent on the binding characteristics of a given toxin. The aim of this study was to analyze the pattern of V beta-expression in polyp-derived lymphocytes from CRSwNP patients. METHODS: Polyps were harvested from 20 patients with CRSwNP and 3 patients with antrochoanal polyps. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the V beta-repertoire of polyp-derived CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. Data were analyzed in light of the known skewing associated with SAg exposure in vivo and in vitro. Skewing was defined as a percentage of V beta-expression >2 SD of that seen in normal blood. RESULTS: Seven of 20 subjects exhibited skewing in V beta-domains with strong associations with S. aureus SAg's. The three antrochoanal polyps failed to show any significant V beta-skewing. CONCLUSION: This study establishes evidence of S. aureus SAg-T-cell interactions in polyp lymphocytes of 35% of CRSwNP patients.

82,"INTRODUCTION: This is a novel minimally invasive surgical method for maxillary sinus mucoceles and antrochoanal polyps. AIM: To describe a modified technique of inferior meatal fenestration with a mucosal flap for maxillary sinus diseases and to present a case series of subjects who underwent this procedure. The novel surgical technique and indications for this approach are also discussed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The authors analyzed data from 32 cases involving patients who underwent resection of maxillary sinus mucoceles and antrochoanal polyps via modified endoscopic inferior meatal fenestration with a mucosal flap in the period from January, 2011 to January, 2016. The group included 19 men and 13 women, and the patients' mean age was 36.2 years (range: 11-56 years). Preoperative and postoperative imaging studies were available in all cases and were reviewed. RESULTS: Thirty-two cases are included in this study. The appearance of nasal and (or) maxillary sinus mucosa was observed in the follow-up at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months using endoscopes. Postoperative computed tomography was performed for only 9 patients in this study. The mean follow-up period was 56 (range: 10-82) months in these cases. All patients had an uneventful post-operative period. Postoperative symptoms were relieved gradually for 1 to 2 weeks after the operation. No patients experienced recurrent symptoms related to the mucocele. Mucocele and polyps recurrence was not observed. No patient showed re-stenosis and obstruction of the nasal cavity, facial pain or numbness during follow-up.

METHODS: A total of 32 patients with ACPs, and 10 control subjects were enrolled in this study. Demographic datas were collected. The TaqMan low-density array assays were used to detect the microbial of swab specimens and nasal tissue samples from ACPs patients. RESULTS: A total of 15 species were identified in all groups. Of all the species, Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the most common species in ACP patients, but was negative in control group. Of all the viruses detected, Adenovirus positivity was significantly higher in control group than that in ACPs middle meatus on unaffected side, ACPs middle meatus on affected side, and ACPs polypous surface group (P < 0.05). Cytomegalovirus positivity was significantly higher in control group than that in ACP polypous group (P < 0.05).

96,"Junin virus (JUNV) is a member of the Arenaviridae family of viruses and is the pathogen responsible for causing Argentine hemorrhagic fever, a potentially lethal disease endemic to Argentina. A live attenuated vaccine for human use, called Candid#1, is approved only in Argentina. Candid#1 vaccine strain of Junin virus was obtained through serial passage in mouse brain tissues followed by passage in Fetal Rhesus macaque lung fibroblast (FRhL) cells. Previously, the mutations responsible for attenuation of this virus in Guinea pigs were mapped in the gene encoding for glycoprotein precursor (GPC) protein. The resulting Candid#1 glycoprotein complex has been shown to cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in vitro resulting in the degradation of the GPC. To evaluate the attenuating properties of specific mutations within GPC, we created recombinant viruses expressing GPC mutations specific to key Candid#1 passages and evaluated their pathogenicity in our outbred Hartley guinea pig model of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. Here, we provide evidence that early mutations in GPC obtained through serial passaging attenuate the visceral disease and increase immunogenicity in guinea pigs. Specific mutations acquired prior to the 13th mouse brain passage (XJ13) are responsible for attenuation of the visceral disease while having no impact on the neurovirulence of Junin virus. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that the mutation within an N-linked glycosylation motif, acquired prior to the 44th mouse brain passage (XJ44), is unstable but necessary for complete attenuation and enhanced immunogenicity of Candid#1 vaccine strain.

97,"Junin virus (JUNV), a member of the family Arenaviridae, is the etiological agent of the Argentine hemorrhagic fever, an endemic disease in the rural region of Argentina lacking a specific chemotherapy. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is expressed in several mammalian tissues and has been indicated as a sensor of ligands from variable sources and a modulator of the cell immune response. Interestingly, recent studies have suggested that the activation or depression of the AHR signaling pathway may play a role in the outcome of diverse human viral infections. In the present report, the effect of the pharmacological modulation of AHR on JUNV in vitro infection was analyzed. An initial microarray screening showed that the AHR pathway was overexpressed in JUNV-infected hepatic cells. Concomitantly, the infection of Vero and Huh-7 cells with the JUNV strains IV4454 and Candid#1 was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with CH223191, a specific AHR antagonist, as detected by infectivity assays, real-time RT-PCR and immunofluorescence detection of viral proteins. Furthermore, the pro-viral role of AHR in JUNV infection appears to be independent of the IFN-I pathway.

98,"Members of the family Arenaviridae are classified into four genera: Antennavirus, Hartmanivirus, Mammarenavirus, and Reptarenavirus. Reptarenaviruses and hartmaniviruses infect (captive) snakes and have been shown to cause boid inclusion body disease (BIBD). Antennaviruses have genomes consisting of 3, rather than 2, segments, and were discovered in actinopterygian fish by next-generation sequencing but no biological isolate has been reported yet. The hosts of mammarenaviruses are mainly rodents and infections are generally asymptomatic. Current knowledge about the biology of reptarenaviruses, hartmaniviruses, and antennaviruses is very limited and their zoonotic potential is unknown. In contrast, some mammarenaviruses are associated with zoonotic events that pose a threat to human health. This review will focus on mammarenavirus genetic diversity and its biological implications. Some mammarenaviruses including lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) are excellent experimental model systems for the investigation of acute and persistent viral infections, whereas others including Lassa (LASV) and Junin (JUNV) viruses, the causative agents of Lassa fever (LF) and Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF), respectively, are important human pathogens. Mammarenaviruses were thought to have high degree of intra-and inter-species amino acid sequence identities, but recent evidence has revealed a high degree of mammarenavirus genetic diversity in the field. Moreover, closely related mammarenavirus can display dramatic phenotypic differences in vivo. These findings support a role of genetic variability in mammarenavirus adaptability and pathogenesis.

99,"Junin virus (JUNV) belongs to the Arenaviridae family and is the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF), a severe human disease endemic to agricultural areas in Argentina. At this moment, there are no effective antiviral therapeutics to battle pathogenic arenaviruses. Cumulative reports from recent years have widely provided information on cellular factors playing key roles during JUNV infection. In this review, we summarize research on host molecular determinants that intervene in the different stages of the viral life cycle: viral entry, replication, assembly and budding. Alongside, we describe JUNV tight interplay with the innate immune system. We also review the development of different reverse genetics systems and their use as tools to study JUNV biology and its close teamwork with the host. Elucidating relevant interactions of the virus with the host cell machinery is highly necessary to better understand the mechanistic basis beyond virus multiplication, disease pathogenesis and viral subversion of the immune response.

100,"Junin virus (JUNV), a member of the family Arenaviridae, is the etiological agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF), a potentially deadly endemic-epidemic disease affecting the population of the most fertile farming land of Argentina. Autophagy is a degradative process with a crucial antiviral role; however, several viruses subvert the pathway to their benefit. We determined the role of autophagy in JUNV-infected cells by analyzing LC3, a cytoplasmic protein (LC3-I) that becomes vesicle membrane associated (LC3-II) upon induction of autophagy. Cells overexpressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-LC3 and infected with JUNV showed an increased number of LC3 punctate structures, similar to those obtained after starvation or bafilomycin A1 treatment, which leads to autophagosome induction or accumulation, respectively. We also monitored the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, observing LC3-II levels in JUNV-infected cells similar to those observed in starved cells. Additionally, we kinetically studied the number of LC3 dots after JUNV infection and found that the virus activated the pathway as early as 2 h postinfection (p.i.), whereas the UV-inactivated virus did not induce the pathway. Cells subjected to starvation or pretreated with rapamycin, a pharmacological autophagy inductor, enhanced virus yield. Also, we assayed the replication capacity of JUNV in Atg5 knockout or Beclin 1 knockdown cells (both critical components of the autophagic pathway) and found a significant decrease in JUNV replication. Taken together, our results constitute the first study indicating that JUNV infection induces an autophagic response, which is functionally required by the virus for efficient propagation.IMPORTANCE Mammalian arenaviruses are zoonotic viruses that cause asymptomatic and persistent infections in their rodent hosts but may produce severe and lethal hemorrhagic fevers in humans. Currently, there are neither effective therapeutic options nor effective vaccines for viral hemorrhagic fevers caused by human-pathogenic arenaviruses, except the vaccine Candid no. 1 against Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF), licensed for human use in areas of endemicity in Argentina. Since arenaviruses remain a severe threat to global public health, more in-depth knowledge of their replication mechanisms would improve our ability to fight these viruses. Autophagy is a lysosomal degradative pathway involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis, representing powerful anti-infective machinery. We show, for the first time for a member of the family Arenaviridae, a proviral role of autophagy in JUNV infection, providing new knowledge in the field of host-virus interaction. Therefore, modulation of virus-induced autophagy could be used as a strategy to block arenavirus infections.",Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenaviridae,"Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenaviridae","""Argentine hemorrhagic fever""[TIAB] AND ""Arenaviridae""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",31118257,10.1128/JVI.02307-18,Junin Virus Promotes Autophagy To Facilitate the Virus Life Cycle.,Journal of virology,2019/05/24,"['A549 Cells', 'Animals', '*Autophagy', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/analysis', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Junin virus/*growth & development', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/analysis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Time Factors', 'Vero Cells', '*Virus Replication']","0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",2019
101,"Virus entry into cells is a multistep process that often requires the subversion of subcellular machineries. A more complete understanding of these steps is necessary to develop new antiviral strategies. While studying the potential role of the actin network and one of its master regulators, the small GTPase Cdc42, during Junin virus (JUNV) entry, we serendipitously uncovered the small molecule ZCL278, reported to inhibit Cdc42 function as an entry inhibitor for JUNV and for vesicular stomatitis virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and dengue virus but not for the nonenveloped poliovirus. Although ZCL278 did not interfere with JUNV attachment to the cell surface or virus particle internalization into host cells, it prevented the release of JUNV ribonucleoprotein cores into the cytosol and decreased pH-mediated viral fusion with host membranes. We also identified SVG-A astroglial cell-derived cells to be highly permissive for JUNV infection and generated new cell lines expressing fluorescently tagged Rab5c or Rab7a or lacking Cdc42 using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-caspase 9 (Cas9) gene-editing strategies. Aided by these tools, we uncovered that perturbations in the actin cytoskeleton or Cdc42 activity minimally affect JUNV entry, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of ZCL278 is not mediated by ZCL278 interfering with the activity of Cdc42. Instead, ZCL278 appears to redistribute viral particles from endosomal to lysosomal compartments. ZCL278 also inhibited JUNV replication in a mouse model, and no toxicity was detected. Together, our data suggest the unexpected antiviral activity of ZCL278 and highlight its potential for use in the development of valuable new tools to study the intracellular trafficking of pathogens. IMPORTANCE: The Junin virus is responsible for outbreaks of Argentine hemorrhagic fever in South America, where 5 million people are at risk. Limited options are currently available to treat infections by Junin virus or other viruses of the Arenaviridae, making the identification of additional tools, including small-molecule inhibitors, of great importance. How Junin virus enters cells is not yet fully understood. Here we describe new cell culture models in which the cells are susceptible to Junin virus infection and to which we applied CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering strategies to help characterize early steps during virus entry. We also uncovered ZCL278 to be a new antiviral small molecule that potently inhibits the cellular entry of the Junin virus and other enveloped viruses. Moreover, we show that ZCL278 also functions in vivo, thereby preventing Junin virus replication in a mouse model, opening the possibility for the discovery of ZCL278 derivatives of therapeutic potential.",Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenaviridae,"Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenaviridae","""Argentine hemorrhagic fever""[TIAB] AND ""Arenaviridae""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",26912630,10.1128/JVI.00103-16,Identification and Characterization of a Novel Broad-Spectrum Virus Entry,Journal of virology,2016/02/26,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clathrin/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Discovery', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Endosomes/drug effects/virology', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Hemorrhagic Fever, American/genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Humans', 'Junin virus/drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Proteolysis', 'Ribonucleoproteins/metabolism', 'Thiourea/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Viral Load', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Attachment/drug effects', 'Virus Internalization/*drug effects', 'Virus Replication/drug effects', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/genetics/metabolism']",0 (Actins),"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",2016

The AHF endemic area coincides geographically with the largest grain export agro-industrial complex of the country [Argentina]. Since the implementation of vaccination with the Candid #1 vaccine, a significant reduction in incidence was achieved and risk patterns were modified. A previous study allowed characterizing these changes and identifying three transmission scenarios: classic, emergent-reemergent, and traveler. The latter scenario includes seasonal migrant workers who move each year, mainly from the province of Santiago del Estero, the endemic area to work in the detasseling of maize. With the objective of protecting this group of workers, a prevention campaign was initiated which included: capacity building of health personnel in the province, health education, and immunization with the vaccine Candid #1. 3,021 workers were vaccinated. Prior to vaccination, serum samples were taken from a group of 104 volunteers. Tests for neutralizing antibodies specific to the Junin virus were performed and 6 (5.76%) tested positive. The unexpected finding of a high percentage of workers with antibodies suggests the need to evaluate several hypotheses: a) that the result is the product of non-probabilistic sampling; b) that it could be people who fell ill in previous travels, c) or who were vaccinated in previous travels; or d) consider this region as an emerging scenario.",Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenaviridae,"Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenaviridae","""Argentine hemorrhagic fever""[TIAB] AND ""Arenaviridae""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",26102120,,[New transmission scenarios of the Argentine hemorrhagic fever since the,Revista peruana de medicina experimental y salud publica,2015/06/24,"[""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/*prevention & control/*virology"", 'Argentina', 'Female', 'Hemorrhagic Fever, American/*prevention & control/*transmission', 'Humans', 'Junin virus/*immunology', 'Male', '*Transients and Migrants', 'Vaccines, Attenuated', '*Viral Vaccines']","0 (Vaccines, Attenuated)",['Journal Article'],2015

Specific antiviral treatments do not exist, and the only commonly used drug, ribavirin, has limited efficacy and can cause severe side effects. The discovery and development of new antivirals are inhibited by the biohazardous nature of the viruses, making them a relatively poorly understood group of human pathogens. We therefore adapted a reverse-genetics minigenome (MG) rescue system based on Junin virus, the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever, for high-throughput screening (HTS). The MG rescue system recapitulates all stages of the virus life cycle and enables screening of small-molecule libraries under biosafety containment level 2 (BSL2) conditions. The HTS resulted in the identification of four candidate compounds with potent activity against a broad panel of arenaviruses, three of which were completely novel. The target for all 4 compounds was the stage of viral entry, which positions the compounds as potentially important leads for future development. IMPORTANCE: The arenavirus family includes several members that are highly pathogenic, causing acute viral hemorrhagic fevers with high mortality rates. No specific effective treatments exist, and although a vaccine is available for Junin virus, the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever, it is licensed for use only in areas where Argentine hemorrhagic fever is endemic.

104,"The Arenaviridae family includes several hemorrhagic fever viruses which are important emerging pathogens. Junin virus, a member of this family, is the etiological agent of Argentine Hemorrhagic Fever (AHF). A collaboration between the Governments of Argentina and the USA rendered the attenuated Junin virus vaccine strain Candid#1. Arenaviruses are enveloped viruses with genomes consisting of two single-stranded RNA species (L and S), each carrying two coding regions separated by a stably structured, non-coding intergenic region. Molecular characterization of the vaccine strain and of its more virulent ancestors, XJ13 (prototype) and XJ#44, allows a systematic approach for the discovery of key elements in virulence attenuation. We show comparisons of sequence information for the S RNA of the strains XJ13, XJ#44 and Candid#1 of Junin virus, along with other strains from the vaccine lineage and a set of Junin virus field strains collected at the AHF endemic area. Comparisons of nucleotide and amino acid sequences revealed different point mutations which might be linked to the attenuated phenotype. The majority of changes are consistent with a progressive attenuation of virulence between XJ13, XJ#44 and Candid#1. We propose that changes found in genomic regions with low natural variation frequencies are more likely to be associated with the virulence attenuation process. We partially sequenced field strains to analyze the genomic variability naturally occurring for Junin virus.

Junin virus (JUNV) belongs to the New World arenavirus serogroup of the Arenaviridae and is the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. We have demonstrated that infection with JUNV in cell culture does not induce apoptosis but leads to cleavage of the nucleoprotein (NP) into discrete products resembling caspase cleavage events. Similar specific NP degradation patterns were also observed in NP-transfected cell lines, and a closer examination of the sequence of NP showed several putative caspase cleavage motifs. Point mutations that abolished these cleavage motifs were consistent with the loss of certain cleavage products. Consistent with these data, further studies showed that treatment with a caspase inhibitor also reduced NP cleavage, indicating that the observed cleavage events were occurring as a result of caspase activity with NP as a substrate. Finally, we showed that expression of NP suppresses the cleavage of caspase 3 in cells treated with an apoptosis activator.

Lassa virus in West Africa and a number of agents in South America produce hemorrhagic fever in persons exposed to aerosolized excretions of the pathogens' rodent hosts. Because arenaviruses are not transmitted by arthropods, and person-to-person spread is rare, human infections occur singly and sporadically, and are usually not diagnosed until the patient is severely ill. Because the arenaviruses are naturally transmitted by the airborne route, they also pose a potential threat as aerosolized bioterror weapons.

108,"BACKGROUND: Lassa and Junin viruses are the most prominent members of the Arenaviridae family of viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever syndromes Lassa fever and Argentine hemorrhagic fever, respectively. At present, ribavirin is the only antiviral drug indicated for use in treatment of these diseases, but because of its limited efficacy in advanced cases of disease and its toxicity, safer and more effective antivirals are needed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we used a model of acute arenaviral infection in outbred guinea pigs based on challenge with an adapted strain of Pichinde virus (PICV) to further preclinical development of T-705 (Favipiravir), a promising broad-spectrum inhibitor of RNA virus infections. The guinea pig-adapted passage 19 PICV was uniformly lethal with an LD(50) of  approximately 5 plaque-forming units and disease was associated with fever, weight loss, thrombocytopenia, coagulation defects, increases in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations, and pantropic viral infection. Favipiravir (300 mg/kg/day, twice daily orally for 14 days) was highly effective, as all animals recovered fully from PICV-induced disease even when therapy was initiated one week after virus challenge when animals were already significantly ill with marked fevers and thrombocytopenia. Antiviral activity and reduced disease severity was evidenced by dramatic reductions in peak serum virus titers and AST concentrations in favipiravir-treated animals. Moreover, a sharp decrease in body temperature was observed shortly after the start of treatment. Oral ribavirin was also evaluated, and although effective, the slower rate of recovery may be a sign of the drug's known toxicity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings support further development of favipiravir for the treatment of severe arenaviral infections. The optimization of the experimental favipiravir treatment regimen in the PICV guinea pig model will inform critical future studies in the same species based on challenge with highly pathogenic arenaviruses such as Lassa and Junin.",Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenaviridae,"Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenaviridae","""Argentine hemorrhagic fever""[TIAB] AND ""Arenaviridae""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",22022624,10.1371/journal.pntd.0001342,Effective oral favipiravir (T-705) therapy initiated after the onset of clinical,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2011/10/25,"['Amides/*administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Arenavirus/drug effects/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Hemorrhagic Fever, American/*drug therapy/virology', 'Humans', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pyrazines/*administration & dosage', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",0 (Amides),"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",2011

112,"Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) is an endemo-epidemic disease caused by Junin virus (JUNV), a member of the arenaviridae family. Although a recently introduced live attenuated vaccine has proven to be effective, AHF remains a potentially lethal infection. Like in other viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF), AHF patients present with fever and hemorrhagic complications. Although the causes of the bleeding are poorly understood, impaired hemostasis, endothelial cell dysfunction and low platelet counts have been described. Thrombocytopenia is a common feature in VHF syndromes, and it is a major sign for its diagnosis. However, the underlying pathogenic mechanism has not yet been elucidated. We hypothesized that thrombocytopenia results from a viral-triggered alteration of the megakaryo/thrombopoiesis process. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of JUNV on megakaryopoiesis using an in vitro model of human CD34+ cells stimulated with thrombopoietin. Our results showed that CD34+ cells are infected with JUNV in a restricted fashion. Infection was transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1)-dependent and the surface expression of TfR1 was higher in infected cultures, suggesting a novel arenaviral dissemination strategy in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Although proliferation, survival, and commitment in JUNV-infected cultures were normal, viral infection impaired thrombopoiesis by decreasing in vitro proplatelet formation, platelet release, and P-selectin externalization via a bystander effect. The decrease in platelet release was also TfR1-dependent, mimicked by poly(I:C), and type I interferon (IFN alpha/beta) was implicated as a key paracrine mediator. Among the relevant molecules studied, only the transcription factor NF-E2 showed a moderate decrease in expression in megakaryocytes from either infected cultures or after type I IFN treatment. Moreover, type I IFN-treated megakaryocytes presented ultrastructural abnormalities resembling the reported thrombocytopenic NF-E2(-/-) mouse phenotype.

Distribution of positive mice was not modified significantly by trapping sites, sex, or age of the animals. The prevalence of LCMV positive urban residents was found to be consistently low (1-3.6%) along the study period, with overage prevalence of 3.3% and values in males (4.6%) significantly higher than in females (2.6%) (P < 0.05). Seven of 432 pregnant women were found to be LCMV positive, but the absence of LCMV antibodies in the newborns demonstrated that the mothers were infected before pregnancy.

114,"BACKGROUND: Junin virus (JV), a member of the Arenaviridae family, is the etiological agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF). A low pH-pulse, induces fusion of Vero cells infected with JV to form syncytia, whose production can be inhibited by neutralizing antibodies against the JV major glycoprotein. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the existence of an antifusogenic activity present in sera obtained from natural infections of AHF over a 20-year period and to study both the fusogenic activity of one pathogenic and two attenuated strains of JV in Vero cells, at different pH. The study sample consisted of sera obtained from two provinces in the Argentine Republic. Vero cells grown in monolayers, were infected with different strains of JV and a 2 h pulse, at different pH, was performed. Syncytium production was evaluated 12 h later, after staining with Giemsa. Neutralization tests against the attenuated strain XJCl3 were carried out and the antifusogenic activity of immunosera was studied by incubating serum with JV-infected Vero cells. Also the fusion activity in Vero cells infected with three JV strains was assayed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A pathogenic strain XJ exhibited the highest fusogenic activity at pH 5. Syncytium formation was prevented by patients' sera obtained from different geographical locations, independently of time of infection. However, when Vero cells were infected with XJ, a significant reduction of syncytium production was observed, though the level of inhibition was lower than that detected in other JV strains-infected cells. These results could be explained by the existence of a conserved domain on JV proteins and also antigenic heterogeneity among strains.",Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenaviridae,"Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenaviridae","""Argentine hemorrhagic fever""[TIAB] AND ""Arenaviridae""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",15780806,,Inhibition of cell fusion in Junin virus-infected cells by sera from Argentine,Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American,2005/03/23,"['Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', '*Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Giant Cells/drug effects/virology', 'Hemorrhagic Fever, American/blood/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Immune Sera/*pharmacology', 'Junin virus/immunology/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Vero Cells']",0 (Immune Sera),"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",2005

The present study reports the effects of the natural flavonoid quercetin (QUER) on the infection of A549 and Vero cells with Junin virus (JUNV), agent of the Argentine HF. By infectivity assays, a very effective dose-dependent reduction of JUNV multiplication was shown by cell pretreatment at 2-6 h prior to the infection at non-cytotoxic concentrations, with 50% effective concentration values in the range of 6.1-7.5 microg/mL. QUER was also active by post-infection treatment but with minor efficacy. Mechanistic studies indicated that QUER mainly affected the early steps of virus adsorption and internalization in the multiplication cycle of JUNV. Treatment with QUER blocked the phosphorylation of Akt without changes in the total protein expression, detected by Western blot, and the consequent perturbation of the PI3K/Akt pathway was also associated with the fluorescence redistribution from membrane to cytoplasm of TfR1, the cell receptor recognized by JUNV.

116,"Junin virus (JUNV) is a member of the Arenaviridae family of viruses and is the pathogen responsible for causing Argentine hemorrhagic fever, a potentially lethal disease endemic to Argentina. A live attenuated vaccine for human use, called Candid#1, is approved only in Argentina. Candid#1 vaccine strain of Junin virus was obtained through serial passage in mouse brain tissues followed by passage in Fetal Rhesus macaque lung fibroblast (FRhL) cells. Previously, the mutations responsible for attenuation of this virus in Guinea pigs were mapped in the gene encoding for glycoprotein precursor (GPC) protein. The resulting Candid#1 glycoprotein complex has been shown to cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in vitro resulting in the degradation of the GPC. To evaluate the attenuating properties of specific mutations within GPC, we created recombinant viruses expressing GPC mutations specific to key Candid#1 passages and evaluated their pathogenicity in our outbred Hartley guinea pig model of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. Here, we provide evidence that early mutations in GPC obtained through serial passaging attenuate the visceral disease and increase immunogenicity in guinea pigs. Specific mutations acquired prior to the 13th mouse brain passage (XJ13) are responsible for attenuation of the visceral disease while having no impact on the neurovirulence of Junin virus. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that the mutation within an N-linked glycosylation motif, acquired prior to the 44th mouse brain passage (XJ44), is unstable but necessary for complete attenuation and enhanced immunogenicity of Candid#1 vaccine strain.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is expressed in several mammalian tissues and has been indicated as a sensor of ligands from variable sources and a modulator of the cell immune response. Interestingly, recent studies have suggested that the activation or depression of the AHR signaling pathway may play a role in the outcome of diverse human viral infections. In the present report, the effect of the pharmacological modulation of AHR on JUNV in vitro infection was analyzed. An initial microarray screening showed that the AHR pathway was overexpressed in JUNV-infected hepatic cells. Concomitantly, the infection of Vero and Huh-7 cells with the JUNV strains IV4454 and Candid#1 was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with CH223191, a specific AHR antagonist, as detected by infectivity assays, real-time RT-PCR and immunofluorescence detection of viral proteins.

In this review, we summarize research on host molecular determinants that intervene in the different stages of the viral life cycle: viral entry, replication, assembly and budding. Alongside, we describe JUNV tight interplay with the innate immune system. We also review the development of different reverse genetics systems and their use as tools to study JUNV biology and its close teamwork with the host. Elucidating relevant interactions of the virus with the host cell machinery is highly necessary to better understand the mechanistic basis beyond virus multiplication, disease pathogenesis and viral subversion of the immune response.

119,"Junin virus (JUNV), a New World arenavirus, is a rodent-borne virus and the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. Humans become infected through exposure to rodent host secreta and excreta and the resulting infection can lead to an acute inflammatory disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Little is understood about the molecular pathogenesis of arenavirus hemorrhagic fever infections. We utilized Reverse Phase Protein Microarrays (RPPA) to compare global alterations in the host proteome following infection with an attenuated vaccine strain, Candid#1 (CD1), and the most parental virulent strain, XJ13, of JUNV in a human cell culture line. Human small airway epithelial cells were infected with CD1 or XJ13 at an MOI of 10, or mock infected. To determine proteomic changes at early timepoints (T = 1, 3, 8 and 24 h), the JUNV infected or mock infected cells were lysed in compatible buffers for RPPA. Out of 113 proteins that were examined by RPPA, 14 proteins were significantly altered following JUNV infection. Several proteins were commonly phosphorylated between the two strains and these correspond to entry and early replication events, to include p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), and nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB). We qualitatively confirmed the alterations of these three proteins following infection by western blot analysis. We also determined that the inhibition of either p38 MAPK, with the small molecule inhibitor SB 203580 or siRNA knockdown, or HSP27, by siRNA knockdown, significantly decreases JUNV replication. Our data suggests that HSP27 phosphorylation at S82 upon virus infection is dependent on p38 MAPK activity.

120,"New World arenaviruses are rodent-transmitted viruses and include a number of pathogens that are responsible for causing severe human disease. This includes Junin virus (JUNV), which is the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. The wild nature and mobility of the rodent reservoir host makes it difficult to control the disease, and currently passive immunization with high-titer neutralizing antibody-containing plasma from convalescent patients is the only specific therapy. However, dwindling supplies of naturally available convalescent plasma, and challenges in developing similar resources for other closely related viruses, have made the development of alternative antibody-based therapeutic approaches of critical importance. In this study, we sought to induce a neutralizing antibody response in rabbits against the receptor-binding subunit of the viral glycoprotein, GP1, and the specific peptide sequences in GP1 involved in cellular receptor contacts. While these specific receptor-interacting peptides did not efficiently induce the production of neutralizing antibodies when delivered as a particulate antigen (as part of hepatitis B virus core-like particles), we showed that recombinant JUNV GP1 purified from transfected mammalian cells induced virus-neutralizing antibodies at high titers in rabbits. Further, neutralization was observed across a range of unrelated JUNV strains, a feature that is critical for effectiveness in the field. These results underscore the potential of GP1 alone to induce a potent neutralizing antibody response and highlight the importance of epitope presentation. In addition, effective virus neutralization by rabbit antibodies supports the potential applicability of this species for the future development of immunotherapeutics (e.g., based on humanized monoclonal antibodies). Such information can be applied in the design of vaccines and immunogens for both prevention and specific therapies against this and likely also other closely related pathogenic New World arenaviruses.",Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenavirus,"Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenavirus","""Argentine hemorrhagic fever""[TIAB] AND ""Arenavirus""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",35214632,10.3390/vaccines10020173,Immunization with GP1 but Not Core-like Particles Displaying Isolated,Vaccines,2022/02/27,,,['Journal Article'],2022

124,"Pathogenicity often differs dramatically among even closely related arenavirus species. For instance, Junin virus (JUNV), the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF), is closely related to Tacaribe virus (TCRV), which is normally avirulent in humans. While little is known about how host cell pathways are regulated in response to arenavirus infection, or how this contributes to virulence, these two viruses have been found to differ markedly in their ability to induce apoptosis. However, details of the mechanism(s) governing the apoptotic response to arenavirus infections are unknown. Here we confirm that TCRV-induced apoptosis is mitochondria-regulated, with associated canonical hallmarks of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and go on to identify the pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 factors responsible for regulating this process. In particular, levels of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins Noxa and Puma, as well as their canonical transcription factor p53, were strongly increased. Interestingly, TCRV infection also led to the accumulation of the inactive phosphorylated form of another pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein, Bad (i.e. as phospho-Bad). Knockout of Noxa or Puma suppressed apoptosis in response to TCRV infection, whereas silencing of Bad increased apoptosis, confirming that these factors are key regulators of apoptosis induction in response to TCRV infection. Further, we found that while the highly pathogenic JUNV does not induce caspase activation, it still activated upstream pro-apoptotic factors, consistent with current models suggesting that JUNV evades apoptosis by interfering with caspase activation through a nucleoprotein-mediated decoy function. This new mechanistic insight into the role that individual BH3-only proteins and their regulation play in controlling apoptotic fate in arenavirus-infected cells provides an important experimental framework for future studies aimed at dissecting differences in the apoptotic responses between arenaviruses, their connection to other cell signaling events and ultimately the relationship of these processes to pathogenesis.",Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenavirus,"Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenavirus","""Argentine hemorrhagic fever""[TIAB] AND ""Arenavirus""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",33045019,10.1371/journal.ppat.1008948,"BH3-only sensors Bad, Noxa and Puma are Key Regulators of Tacaribe virus-induced",PLoS pathogens,2020/10/13,"['*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Arenaviridae Infections/genetics/metabolism/*pathology/virology', 'Arenaviruses, New World/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Protein Domains', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', '*Virus Replication', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins),"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",2020

127,"Argentine hemorrhagic fever is a potentially lethal disease that is caused by Junin virus (JUNV). There are currently around 5 million individuals at risk of infection within regions of endemicity in Argentina. The live attenuated vaccine strain Candid #1 (Can) is approved for use in regions of endemicity and has substantially decreased the number of annual Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) cases. The glycoprotein (GPC) gene is primarily responsible for attenuation of the Can strain, and we have shown that the absence of an N-linked glycosylation motif in the subunit G1 of the glycoprotein complex of Can, which is otherwise present in the wild-type pathogenic JUNV, causes GPC retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we show that Can GPC aggregates in the ER of infected cells, forming incorrect cross-chain disulfide bonds, which results in impaired GPC processing into G1 and G2. The GPC fails to cleave into its G1 and G2 subunits and is targeted for degradation within lysosomes. Cells infected with the wild-type Romero (Rom) strain do not produce aggregates that are observed in Can infection, and the stress on the ER remains minimal. While the mutation of the N-linked glycosylation motif (T168A) is primarily responsible for the formation of aggregates, other mutations within G1 that occurred earlier in the passage history of the Can strain also contribute to aggregation of the GPC within the ER.IMPORTANCE The development of vaccines and therapeutics to combat viral hemorrhagic fevers remains a top priority within the Implementation Plan of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise.

128,"Several clade B New World arenaviruses (NWAs) can cause severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever, for which preventive and therapeutic measures are severely limited. These NWAs use human transferrin receptor 1 (hTfR1) as a host cell receptor for virus entry. The most prevalent of the pathogenic NWAs is Junin virus (JUNV), the etiological agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. Small animal models of JUNV infection are limited because most laboratory rodent species are refractory to disease. Only guinea pigs are known to develop disease following JUNV infection, but the underlying mechanisms are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate marked susceptibility of Hartley guinea pigs to uniformly lethal disease when challenged with as few as 4 PFU of the Romero strain of JUNV. In vitro, we show that infection of primary guinea pig macrophages results in greater JUNV replication compared to infection of hamster or mouse macrophages. We provide evidence that the guinea pig TfR1 (gpTfR1) is the principal receptor for JUNV, while hamster and mouse orthologs fail to support viral entry/infection of pseudotyped murine leukemia viruses expressing pathogenic NWA glycoproteins or JUNV. Together, our results indicate that gpTfR1 serves as the primary receptor for pathogenic NWAs, enhancing viral infection in guinea pigs.IMPORTANCE JUNV is one of five known NWAs that cause viral hemorrhagic fever in humans. Countermeasures against JUNV infection are limited to immunization with the Candid#1 vaccine and immune plasma, which are available only in Argentina. The gold standard small animal model for JUNV infection is the guinea pig. Here, we demonstrate high sensitivity of this species to severe JUNV infection and identify gpTfR1 as the primary receptor. Use of hTfR1 for host cell entry is a feature shared by pathogenic NWAs. Our results show that expression of gpTfR1 or hTfR1 comparably enhances JUNV virus entry/infectivity. Our findings shed light on JUNV infection in guinea pigs as a model for human disease and suggest that similar pathophysiological mechanisms related to iron sequestration during infection and regulation of TfR1 expression may be shared between humans and guinea pigs.

129,"The New World arenavirus Junin (JUNV) is the etiological agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF). Previous studies of human macrophage infection by the Old-World arenaviruses Mopeia and Lassa showed that while the non-pathogenic Mopeia virus replicates and activates human macrophages, the pathogenic Lassa virus replicates but fails to activate human macrophages. Less is known in regard to the impact of New World arenavirus infection on the human macrophage immune response. Macrophage activation is critical for controlling infections but could also be usurped favoring immune evasion. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how the JUNV infection modulates macrophage plasticity to clarify its role in AHF pathogenesis. With this aim in mind, we compared infection with the attenuated Candid 1 (C#1) or the pathogenic P strains of the JUNV virus in human macrophage cultures. The results showed that both JUNV strains similarly replicated and induced morphological changes as early as 1 day post-infection. However, both strains differentially induced the expression of CD71, the receptor for cell entry, the activation and maturation molecules CD80, CD86, and HLA-DR and selectively modulated cytokine production. Higher levels of TNF-alpha, IL-10, and IL-12 were detected with C#1 strain, while the P strain induced only higher levels of IL-6. We also found that C#1 strain infection skewed macrophage polarization to M1, whereas the P strain shifted the response to an M2 phenotype. Interestingly, the MERTK receptor, that negatively regulates the immune response, was down-regulated by C#1 strain and up-regulated by P strain infection. Similarly, the target genes of MERTK activation, the cytokine suppressors SOCS1 and SOCS3, were also increased after P strain infection, in addition to IRF-1, that regulates type I IFN levels, which were higher with C#1 compared with P strain infection. Together, this differential activation/polarization pattern of macrophages elicited by P strain suggests a more evasive immune response and may have important implications in the pathogenesis of AHF and underpinning the development of new potential therapeutic strategies.",Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenavirus,"Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenavirus","""Argentine hemorrhagic fever""[TIAB] AND ""Arenavirus""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",31695702,10.3389/fimmu.2019.02499,Junin Virus Triggers Macrophage Activation and Modulates Polarization According,Frontiers in immunology,2019/11/07,"['Animals', 'B7-1 Antigen/immunology', 'B7-2 Antigen/immunology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/immunology', 'Hemorrhagic Fever, American/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Junin virus/*immunology', '*Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Species Specificity', 'Vero Cells']",0 (B7-1 Antigen),"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",2019
130,"BACKGROUND: The arenavirus Junin virus (JUNV), causative agent of the argentine hemorrhagic fever, is able to modulate several signaling pathways involved in cell survival and multiplication. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to characterize the infection of rat osteoblasts (OBCs) with JUNV and its consequence on the modulation of osteogenic genes expression, thus studying the ability of this virus to induce cell differentiation. In addition, we evaluated the effect of purinergic agonists on viral replication. METHOD: Quantification of infectivity by plaque forming unit (PFU) assay, synthesis of viral proteins by western blot and immunofluorescence, and expression of osteogenic differentiation markers (ODM) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were employed. RESULTS: Infection of OBCs with JUNV (MOI 0.01 PFU/cell) showed a peak of infectivity, reaching 1.5 x 105 PFU/mL at the second day post-infection (p.i.). A marked restriction in multiplication was detected at day 7 p.i. that did not impair the establishment of a persistent stage of infection in OBCs. Analysis of mRNAs corresponding to ODM such as alkaline phosphatase, bone sialo-protein, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 4 and 6 revealed that only the levels of BMP-6 were significantly higher in infected cells. Treatment with the purinergic agonists ATPgammaS, UTP, ADP, or UDP diminished viral titer and reduced the expression of the viral nucleoprotein. Also, treatment with 10 muM ATPgammaS reduced the stimulation of BMP-6 expression induced by the infection. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that JUNV is capable of infecting OBCs and point out BMP-6 as a key factor during this process.",Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenavirus,"Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenavirus","""Argentine hemorrhagic fever""[TIAB] AND ""Arenavirus""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",31121597,10.1159/000499466,Infection of Rat Osteoblasts with Junin Virus Promotes the Expression of Bone,Intervirology,2019/05/24,"['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 6/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Junin virus/*physiology', 'Osteoblasts/drug effects/*virology', 'Osteogenesis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Purinergic Agonists/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']","0 (Bmp6 protein, rat)",['Journal Article'],2019
131,"Junin virus (JUNV), a member of the family Arenaviridae, is the etiological agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF), a potentially deadly endemic-epidemic disease affecting the population of the most fertile farming land of Argentina. Autophagy is a degradative process with a crucial antiviral role; however, several viruses subvert the pathway to their benefit. We determined the role of autophagy in JUNV-infected cells by analyzing LC3, a cytoplasmic protein (LC3-I) that becomes vesicle membrane associated (LC3-II) upon induction of autophagy. Cells overexpressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-LC3 and infected with JUNV showed an increased number of LC3 punctate structures, similar to those obtained after starvation or bafilomycin A1 treatment, which leads to autophagosome induction or accumulation, respectively. We also monitored the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, observing LC3-II levels in JUNV-infected cells similar to those observed in starved cells. Additionally, we kinetically studied the number of LC3 dots after JUNV infection and found that the virus activated the pathway as early as 2 h postinfection (p.i.), whereas the UV-inactivated virus did not induce the pathway. Cells subjected to starvation or pretreated with rapamycin, a pharmacological autophagy inductor, enhanced virus yield. Also, we assayed the replication capacity of JUNV in Atg5 knockout or Beclin 1 knockdown cells (both critical components of the autophagic pathway) and found a significant decrease in JUNV replication. Taken together, our results constitute the first study indicating that JUNV infection induces an autophagic response, which is functionally required by the virus for efficient propagation.IMPORTANCE Mammalian arenaviruses are zoonotic viruses that cause asymptomatic and persistent infections in their rodent hosts but may produce severe and lethal hemorrhagic fevers in humans. Currently, there are neither effective therapeutic options nor effective vaccines for viral hemorrhagic fevers caused by human-pathogenic arenaviruses, except the vaccine Candid no. 1 against Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF), licensed for human use in areas of endemicity in Argentina. Since arenaviruses remain a severe threat to global public health, more in-depth knowledge of their replication mechanisms would improve our ability to fight these viruses. Autophagy is a lysosomal degradative pathway involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis, representing powerful anti-infective machinery. We show, for the first time for a member of the family Arenaviridae, a proviral role of autophagy in JUNV infection, providing new knowledge in the field of host-virus interaction.

132,"Arenaviruses are a significant cause of hemorrhagic fever, an often-fatal disease for which there is no approved antiviral therapy. Lassa fever in particular generates high morbidity and mortality in West Africa, where the disease is endemic, and a recent outbreak in Nigeria was larger and more geographically diverse than usual. We are developing LHF-535, a small-molecule viral entry inhibitor that targets the arenavirus envelope glycoprotein, as a therapeutic candidate for Lassa fever and other hemorrhagic fevers of arenavirus origin. Using a lentiviral pseudotype infectivity assay, we determined that LHF-535 had sub-nanomolar potency against the viral envelope glycoproteins from all Lassa virus lineages, with the exception of the glycoprotein from the LP strain from lineage I, which was 100-fold less sensitive than that of other strains. This reduced sensitivity was mediated by a unique amino acid substitution, V434I, in the transmembrane domain of the envelope glycoprotein GP2 subunit. This position corresponds to the attenuation determinant of Candid#1, a live-attenuated Junin virus vaccine strain used to prevent Argentine hemorrhagic fever. Using a virus-yield reduction assay, we determined that LHF-535 potently inhibited Junin virus, but not Candid#1, and the Candid#1 attenuation determinant, F427I, regulated this difference in sensitivity. We also demonstrated that a daily oral dose of LHF-535 at 10 mg/kg protected mice from a lethal dose of Tacaribe virus. Serial passage of Tacaribe virus in LHF-535-treated Vero cells yielded viruses that were resistant to LHF-535, and the majority of drug-resistant viruses exhibited attenuated pathogenesis.

The treatment with non-cytotoxic concentrations of A771726 of Vero and A549 cells infected with JUNV inhibited virus replication in a dose-dependent manner, as determined by virus yield reduction assay. The antiviral effectiveness of A771726 was not importantly affected by the multiplicity of infection and the virus strain. Moreover, the combination of A771726 and ribavirin had a significantly more potent antiviral activity than each single drug treatment. Mechanistic studies showed that the main action of A771726 is exerted before 6 h of JUNV infection. Accordingly, inhibition of viral RNA synthesis was detected in treated infected cells by real time RT-PCR. The exogenous addition of uridine or orotic acid produced a partial reversal of the inhibitory effect of A771726 on infective virus production whereas a total reversion was detected on JUNV RNA synthesis, probably by restoration of the enzymatic activity of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) and the intracellular pyrimidine pools. In conclusion, these results suggest that the antiviral target would be viral RNA synthesis through pyrimidine depletion, but any other effect of the compound on JUNV infection cannot be excluded.

134,"Arenaviruses are negative-strand, enveloped RNA viruses that cause significant human disease. In particular, Junin mammarenavirus (JUNV) is the etiologic agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. At present, little is known about the cellular proteins that the arenavirus matrix protein (Z) hijacks to accomplish its various functions, including driving the process of virus release. Furthermore, there is little knowledge regarding host proteins incorporated into arenavirus particles and their importance for virion function. To address these deficiencies, we used mass spectrometry to identify human proteins that (i) interact with the JUNV matrix protein inside cells or within virus-like particles (VLPs) and/or (ii) are incorporated into bona fide JUNV strain Candid#1 particles. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that multiple classes of human proteins were overrepresented in the data sets, including ribosomal proteins, Ras superfamily proteins, and endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) proteins. Several of these proteins were required for the propagation of JUNV (ADP ribosylation factor 1 [ARF1], ATPase, H(+) transporting, lysosomal 38-kDa, V0 subunit d1 [ATP6V0D1], and peroxiredoxin 3 [PRDX3]), lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus (LCMV) (Rab5c), or both viruses (ATP synthase, H(+) transporting, mitochondrial F1 complex, beta polypeptide [ATP5B] and IMP dehydrogenase 2 [IMPDH2]). Furthermore, we show that the release of infectious JUNV particles, but not LCMV particles, requires a functional ESCRT pathway and that ATP5B and IMPDH2 are required for JUNV budding. In summary, we have provided a large-scale map of host machinery that associates with JUNV and identified key human proteins required for its propagation. This data set provides a resource for the field to guide antiviral target discovery and to better understand the biology of the arenavirus matrix protein and the importance of host proteins for virion function.IMPORTANCE Arenaviruses are deadly human pathogens for which there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccines and only limited treatment options.

135,"The Candid#1 strain of Junin virus was developed using a conventional attenuation strategy of serial passage in nonhost animals and cultured cells. The live-attenuated Candid#1 vaccine is used in Argentina to protect at-risk individuals against Argentine hemorrhagic fever, but it has not been licensed in the United States. Recent studies have revealed that Candid#1 attenuation is entirely dependent on a phenylalanine-to-isoleucine substitution at position 427 in the fusion subunit (GP2) of the viral envelope glycoprotein complex (GPC), thereby raising concerns regarding the potential for reversion to virulence. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of an intragenic epistatic interaction between the attenuating F427I mutation in GP2 and a lysine-to-serine mutation at position 33 in the stable signal peptide (SSP) subunit of GPC, and we demonstrate the utility of this interaction in creating an evolutionary barrier against reversion to the pathogenic genotype. In the presence of the wild-type F427 residue, the K33S mutation abrogates the ability of ectopically expressed GPC to mediate membrane fusion at endosomal pH. This defect is rescued by the attenuating F427I mutation. We show that the recombinant Candid#1 (rCan) virus bearing K33S GPC is viable and retains its attenuated genotype under cell culture conditions that readily select for reversion in the parental rCan virus. If back-mutation to F427 offers an accessible pathway to increase fitness in rCan, reversion in K33S-GPC rCan is likely to be lethal. The epistatic interaction between K33S and F427I thus may minimize the likelihood of reversion and enhance safety in a second-generation Candid#1 vaccine.IMPORTANCE The live-attenuated Candid#1 vaccine strain of Junin virus is used to protect against Argentine hemorrhagic fever. Recent findings that a single missense mutation in the viral envelope glycoprotein complex (GPC) is responsible for attenuation raise the prospect of facile reversion to pathogenicity. Here, we characterize a genetic interaction between GPC subunits that evolutionarily forces retention of the attenuating mutation. By incorporating this secondary mutation into Candid#1 GPC, we hope to minimize the likelihood of reversion and enhance safety in a second-generation Candid#1 vaccine.

Comparison of our structure with that of a previously reported nAb complex (JUNV GP1-GD01) reveals largely overlapping epitopes but highly distinct antibody-binding modes.

138,"Junin virus (JUNV), a highly pathogenic New World arenavirus, is the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF). The live-attenuated Candid #1 (Can) strain currently serves as a vaccine for at-risk populations. We have previously shown that the Can glycoprotein (GPC) gene is the primary gene responsible for attenuation in a guinea pig model of AHF. However, the mechanisms through which the GPC contributes to the attenuation of the Can strain remain unknown. A more complete understanding of the mechanisms underlying the attenuation and immunogenicity of the Can strain will potentially allow for the rational design of additional safe and novel vaccines. Here, we provide a detailed comparison of both RNA and protein expression profiles between both inter- and intra-segment chimeric JUNV recombinant clones expressing combinations of genes from the Can strain and the pathogenic Romero (Rom) strain. The recombinant viruses that express Can GPC, which were shown to be attenuated in guinea pigs, displayed different RNA levels and GPC processing patterns as determined by Northern and Western blot analyses, respectively. Analysis of recombinant viruses containing amino acid substitutions selected at different mouse brain passages during the generation of Can revealed that altered Can GPC processing was primarily due to the T168A substitution within G1, which eliminates an N-linked glycosylation motif. Incorporation of the T168A substitution in the Rom GPC resulted in a Can-like processing pattern of Rom GPC. In addition, JUNV GPCs containing T168A substitution were retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and displayed significantly lower cell surface expression than wild-type Rom GPC.

139,"Machupo virus (MACV), a New World arenavirus, is the etiological agent of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever (BHF). Junin virus (JUNV), a close relative, causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF). Previously, we reported that a recombinant, chimeric MACV (rMACV/Cd#1-GPC) expressing glycoprotein from the Candid#1 (Cd#1) vaccine strain of JUNV is completely attenuated in a murine model and protects animals from lethal challenge with MACV. A rMACV with a single F438I substitution in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of GPC, which is equivalent to the F427I attenuating mutation in Cd#1 GPC, was attenuated in a murine model but genetically unstable. In addition, the TMD mutation alone was not sufficient to fully attenuate JUNV, indicating that other domains of the GPC may also contribute to the attenuation. To investigate the requirement of different domains of Cd#1 GPC for successful attenuation of MACV, we rescued several rMACVs expressing the ectodomain of GPC from Cd#1 either alone (MCg1), along with the TMD F438I substitution (MCg2), or with the TMD of Cd#1 (MCg3). All rMACVs exhibited similar growth curves in cultured cells. In mice, the MCg1 displayed significant reduction in lethality as compared with rMACV. The MCg1 was detected in brains and spleens of MCg1-infected mice and the infection was associated with tissue inflammation. On the other hand, all animals survived MCg2 and MCg3 infection without detectable levels of virus in various organs while producing neutralizing antibody against Cd#1.

Junin virus, the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF), is an arenavirus identified as a category A high-priority agent. There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs available for preventing or treating AHF, and the current treatment option is limited to administration of immune plasma. Whereas immune plasma demonstrates the feasibility of passive immunotherapy, it is limited in quantity, variable in quality, and poses safety risks such as transmission of transfusion-borne diseases. In an effort to develop a monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based alternative to plasma, three previously described neutralizing murine mAbs were expressed as mouse-human chimeric antibodies and evaluated in the guinea pig model of AHF. These mAbs provided 100% protection against lethal challenge when administered 2 d after infection (dpi), and one of them (J199) was capable of providing 100% protection when treatment was initiated 6 dpi and 92% protection when initiated 7 dpi.

The live-attenuated Candid #1 (Can) strain of JUNV is currently used to vaccinate the human population at risk. However, the mechanism of attenuation of this strain is still largely unknown. Therefore, the identification and functional characterization of viral genetic determinants dictating JUNV virulence or attenuation would significantly improve the understanding of the mechanisms underlying AHF and facilitate the development of novel, more effective, and safer vaccines. Here, we utilized a reverse genetics approach to generate recombinant JUNV (rJUNV) strains encoding different gene combinations of the pathogenic Romero (Rom) and attenuated Can strains of JUNV. All strains of rJUNV exhibited in vitro growth kinetics similar to those of their parental counterparts. Analysis of virulence of the rJUNV in a guinea pig model of lethal infection that closely reproduces the features of AHF identified the envelope glycoproteins (GPs) as the major determinants of pathogenesis and attenuation of JUNV. Accordingly, rJUNV strains expressing the full-length GPs of Rom and Can exhibited virulent and attenuated phenotypes, respectively, in guinea pigs. Mutation F427I in the transmembrane region of JUNV envelope glycoprotein GP2 has been shown to attenuate the neurovirulence of JUNV in suckling mice. We document that in the guinea pig model of AHF, mutation F427I in GP2 is also highly attenuating but insufficient to prevent virus dissemination and development of mild clinical and pathological symptoms, indicating that complete attenuation of JUNV requires additional mutations present in Can glycoprotein precursor (GPC).

Junin virus (JUNV) belongs to the New World arenavirus serogroup of the Arenaviridae and is the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. We have demonstrated that infection with JUNV in cell culture does not induce apoptosis but leads to cleavage of the nucleoprotein (NP) into discrete products resembling caspase cleavage events. Similar specific NP degradation patterns were also observed in NP-transfected cell lines, and a closer examination of the sequence of NP showed several putative caspase cleavage motifs. Point mutations that abolished these cleavage motifs were consistent with the loss of certain cleavage products. Consistent with these data, further studies showed that treatment with a caspase inhibitor also reduced NP cleavage, indicating that the observed cleavage events were occurring as a result of caspase activity with NP as a substrate. Finally, we showed that expression of NP suppresses the cleavage of caspase 3 in cells treated with an apoptosis activator.

152,"BACKGROUND: Lassa and Junin viruses are the most prominent members of the Arenaviridae family of viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever syndromes Lassa fever and Argentine hemorrhagic fever, respectively. At present, ribavirin is the only antiviral drug indicated for use in treatment of these diseases, but because of its limited efficacy in advanced cases of disease and its toxicity, safer and more effective antivirals are needed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we used a model of acute arenaviral infection in outbred guinea pigs based on challenge with an adapted strain of Pichinde virus (PICV) to further preclinical development of T-705 (Favipiravir), a promising broad-spectrum inhibitor of RNA virus infections. The guinea pig-adapted passage 19 PICV was uniformly lethal with an LD(50) of  approximately 5 plaque-forming units and disease was associated with fever, weight loss, thrombocytopenia, coagulation defects, increases in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations, and pantropic viral infection. Favipiravir (300 mg/kg/day, twice daily orally for 14 days) was highly effective, as all animals recovered fully from PICV-induced disease even when therapy was initiated one week after virus challenge when animals were already significantly ill with marked fevers and thrombocytopenia. Antiviral activity and reduced disease severity was evidenced by dramatic reductions in peak serum virus titers and AST concentrations in favipiravir-treated animals. Moreover, a sharp decrease in body temperature was observed shortly after the start of treatment.

Several pathogenic strains of JUNV have been documented, and a highly attenuated vaccine strain (Candid #1) was generated and used to vaccinate the human population at risk. The identification and functional characterization of viral genetic determinants associated with AHF and Candid #1 attenuation would contribute to the elucidation of the mechanisms contributing to AHF and the development of better vaccines and therapeutics. To this end, we used reverse genetics to rescue the pathogenic Romero and the attenuated Candid #1 strains of JUNV from cloned cDNAs. Both recombinant Candid #1 (rCandid #1) and Romero (rRomero) had the same growth properties and phenotypic features in cultured cells and in vivo as their corresponding parental viruses. Infection with rRomero caused 100% lethality in guinea pigs, whereas rCandid #1 infection was asymptomatic and provided protection against a lethal challenge with Romero. Notably, Romero and Candid #1 trans-acting proteins, L and NP, required for virus RNA replication and gene expression were exchangeable in a minigenome rescue assay. These findings support the feasibility of studies aimed at determining the contribution of each viral gene to JUNV pathogenesis and attenuation. In addition, we rescued Candid #1 viruses with three segments that efficiently expressed foreign genes introduced into their genomes.

Furthermore, the lack of effect of this Z-siRNA on the expression of other JUNV proteins, such as N and GPC, confirmed the specificity of action exerted by Z2-siRNA on Z transcript.

The use of a live attenuated vaccine has markedly reduced the incidence of AHF. Present specific therapy involves the transfusion of immune plasma in defined doses of neutralizing antibodies during the prodromal phase of illness. However, alternative forms of treatment are called for due to current difficulties in early detection of AHF, related to its decrease in incidence, troubles in maintaining adequate stocks of immune plasma, and the absence of effective therapies for severely ill patients that progress to a neurologic-hemorrhagic phase.

161,"Arenaviruses comprise a diverse family of rodent-borne viruses that are responsible for recurring and emerging outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers worldwide. The Junin virus, a member of the New World arenaviruses, is endemic to the pampas grasslands of Argentina and is the etiologic agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. In this study, we have analyzed the assembly and function of the Junin virus envelope glycoproteins. The mature envelope glycoprotein complex is proteolytically processed from the GP-C precursor polypeptide and consists of three noncovalently associated subunits, G1, G2, and a stable 58-amino-acid signal peptide. This tripartite organization is found both on virions of the attenuated Candid 1 strain and in cells expressing the pathogenic MC2 strain GP-C gene. Replacement of the Junin virus GP-C signal peptide with that of human CD4 has little effect on glycoprotein assembly while abolishing the ability of the G1-G2 complex to mediate pH-dependent cell-cell fusion. In addition, we demonstrate that the Junin virus GP-C signal peptide subunit is myristoylated at its N-terminal glycine. Alanine substitution for the modified glycine residue in the GP-C signal peptide does not affect formation of the tripartite envelope glycoprotein complex but markedly reduces its membrane fusion activity. In contrast to the classical view that signal peptides act primarily in targeting nascent polypeptides to the endoplasmic reticulum, we suggest that the signal peptide of the arenavirus GP-C may serve additional functions in envelope glycoprotein structure and trafficking.",Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenavirus,"Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Arenavirus","""Argentine hemorrhagic fever""[TIAB] AND ""Arenavirus""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",15367645,,The signal peptide of the Junin arenavirus envelope glycoprotein is myristoylated,Journal of virology,2004/09/16,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'CD4 Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Fusion', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Glycoproteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Junin virus/*chemistry', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Precursors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Sorting Signals/*physiology', 'Protein Subunits/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism']",0 (CD4 Antigens),"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",2004

166,"Virus entry into cells is a multistep process that often requires the subversion of subcellular machineries. A more complete understanding of these steps is necessary to develop new antiviral strategies. While studying the potential role of the actin network and one of its master regulators, the small GTPase Cdc42, during Junin virus (JUNV) entry, we serendipitously uncovered the small molecule ZCL278, reported to inhibit Cdc42 function as an entry inhibitor for JUNV and for vesicular stomatitis virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and dengue virus but not for the nonenveloped poliovirus. Although ZCL278 did not interfere with JUNV attachment to the cell surface or virus particle internalization into host cells, it prevented the release of JUNV ribonucleoprotein cores into the cytosol and decreased pH-mediated viral fusion with host membranes. We also identified SVG-A astroglial cell-derived cells to be highly permissive for JUNV infection and generated new cell lines expressing fluorescently tagged Rab5c or Rab7a or lacking Cdc42 using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-caspase 9 (Cas9) gene-editing strategies. Aided by these tools, we uncovered that perturbations in the actin cytoskeleton or Cdc42 activity minimally affect JUNV entry, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of ZCL278 is not mediated by ZCL278 interfering with the activity of Cdc42. Instead, ZCL278 appears to redistribute viral particles from endosomal to lysosomal compartments. ZCL278 also inhibited JUNV replication in a mouse model, and no toxicity was detected. Together, our data suggest the unexpected antiviral activity of ZCL278 and highlight its potential for use in the development of valuable new tools to study the intracellular trafficking of pathogens. IMPORTANCE: The Junin virus is responsible for outbreaks of Argentine hemorrhagic fever in South America, where 5 million people are at risk. Limited options are currently available to treat infections by Junin virus or other viruses of the Arenaviridae, making the identification of additional tools, including small-molecule inhibitors, of great importance. How Junin virus enters cells is not yet fully understood.

Ribavirin is the only other licensed drug with activity against multiple RNA viruses. Recent studies show that ribavirin and favipiravir act synergistically to inhibit bunyavirus infections in cultured cells and laboratory mice, likely due to their different mechanisms of action. Convalescent immune globulin is the only approved treatment for Argentine hemorrhagic fever caused by the rodent-borne Junin arenavirus. We previously reported that favipiravir is highly effective in a number of small animal models of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. We now report that addition of low dose of ribavirin synergistically potentiates the activity of favipiravir against Junin virus infection of guinea pigs and another arenavirus, Pichinde virus infection of hamsters.

168,"The purpose of this report is to advocate speedy approval and less stringent regulations for the use of experimental drugs such as favipiravir in emergencies. Favipiravir is a new antiviral medication that can be used in emerging viral pandemics such as Ebola virus, 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 virus, Lassa fever, and Argentine hemorrhagic fever. Although favipiravir is one of the choices for the treatment of patients with Ebola virus, several concerns exist. First, a clinical trial of favipiravir in patients infected with the Ebola virus has not yet been conducted, and further studies are required. Second, favipiravir has a risk for teratogenicity and embryotoxicity. Therefore, the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labor of Japan has approved this medication with strict regulations for its production and clinical use. However, owing to the emerging Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, on August 15, 2014, the Minister of Health, Welfare and Labor of Japan approved the use of favipiravir, if needed.",Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Ebola virus,"Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Ebola virus","""Argentine hemorrhagic fever""[TIAB] AND (""Ebola virus""[TIAB] OR ""Ebola""[TIAB]) AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",25544306,10.1017/dmp.2014.151,Favipiravir: a new medication for the Ebola virus disease pandemic.,Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,2014/12/30,"['Amides/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disaster Planning', 'Drug Approval', 'Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Pyrazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",0 (Amides),['Journal Article'],2014
169,"There are currently no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines or therapeutics to prevent or treat Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF). The causative agent of AHF is Junin virus (JUNV); a New World arenavirus classified as a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention category A priority pathogen. The PTAP late (L) domain motif within JUNV Z protein facilitates virion egress and transmission by recruiting host Tsg101 and other ESCRT complex proteins to promote scission of the virus particle from the plasma membrane. Here, we describe a novel compound (compound 0013) that blocks the JUNV Z-Tsg101 interaction and inhibits budding of virus-like particles (VLPs) driven by ectopic expression of the Z protein and live-attenuated JUNV Candid-1 strain in cell culture. Since inhibition of the PTAP-Tsg101 interaction inhibits JUNV egress, compound 0013 serves as a prototype therapeutic that could reduce virus dissemination and disease progression in infected individuals. Moreover, since PTAP l-domain-mediated Tsg101 recruitment is utilized by other RNA virus pathogens (e.g., Ebola virus and HIV-1), PTAP inhibitors such as compound 0013 have the potential to function as potent broad-spectrum, host-oriented antiviral drugs.

170,"Virus entry into cells is a multistep process that often requires the subversion of subcellular machineries. A more complete understanding of these steps is necessary to develop new antiviral strategies. While studying the potential role of the actin network and one of its master regulators, the small GTPase Cdc42, during Junin virus (JUNV) entry, we serendipitously uncovered the small molecule ZCL278, reported to inhibit Cdc42 function as an entry inhibitor for JUNV and for vesicular stomatitis virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and dengue virus but not for the nonenveloped poliovirus. Although ZCL278 did not interfere with JUNV attachment to the cell surface or virus particle internalization into host cells, it prevented the release of JUNV ribonucleoprotein cores into the cytosol and decreased pH-mediated viral fusion with host membranes. We also identified SVG-A astroglial cell-derived cells to be highly permissive for JUNV infection and generated new cell lines expressing fluorescently tagged Rab5c or Rab7a or lacking Cdc42 using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-caspase 9 (Cas9) gene-editing strategies. Aided by these tools, we uncovered that perturbations in the actin cytoskeleton or Cdc42 activity minimally affect JUNV entry, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of ZCL278 is not mediated by ZCL278 interfering with the activity of Cdc42. Instead, ZCL278 appears to redistribute viral particles from endosomal to lysosomal compartments. ZCL278 also inhibited JUNV replication in a mouse model, and no toxicity was detected. Together, our data suggest the unexpected antiviral activity of ZCL278 and highlight its potential for use in the development of valuable new tools to study the intracellular trafficking of pathogens. IMPORTANCE: The Junin virus is responsible for outbreaks of Argentine hemorrhagic fever in South America, where 5 million people are at risk. Limited options are currently available to treat infections by Junin virus or other viruses of the Arenaviridae, making the identification of additional tools, including small-molecule inhibitors, of great importance. How Junin virus enters cells is not yet fully understood.

173,"New World arenaviruses are rodent-transmitted viruses and include a number of pathogens that are responsible for causing severe human disease. This includes Junin virus (JUNV), which is the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. The wild nature and mobility of the rodent reservoir host makes it difficult to control the disease, and currently passive immunization with high-titer neutralizing antibody-containing plasma from convalescent patients is the only specific therapy. However, dwindling supplies of naturally available convalescent plasma, and challenges in developing similar resources for other closely related viruses, have made the development of alternative antibody-based therapeutic approaches of critical importance. In this study, we sought to induce a neutralizing antibody response in rabbits against the receptor-binding subunit of the viral glycoprotein, GP1, and the specific peptide sequences in GP1 involved in cellular receptor contacts. While these specific receptor-interacting peptides did not efficiently induce the production of neutralizing antibodies when delivered as a particulate antigen (as part of hepatitis B virus core-like particles), we showed that recombinant JUNV GP1 purified from transfected mammalian cells induced virus-neutralizing antibodies at high titers in rabbits. Further, neutralization was observed across a range of unrelated JUNV strains, a feature that is critical for effectiveness in the field. These results underscore the potential of GP1 alone to induce a potent neutralizing antibody response and highlight the importance of epitope presentation. In addition, effective virus neutralization by rabbit antibodies supports the potential applicability of this species for the future development of immunotherapeutics (e.g., based on humanized monoclonal antibodies). Such information can be applied in the design of vaccines and immunogens for both prevention and specific therapies against this and likely also other closely related pathogenic New World arenaviruses.",Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Hepatitis B virus,"Argentine hemorrhagic fever,Hepatitis B virus","""Argentine hemorrhagic fever""[TIAB] AND (""Hepatitis B virus""[TIAB] OR ""human hepatitis B virus HBV""[TIAB] OR ""hepatitis B virus ""[TIAB] OR ""Human hepatitis B virus""[TIAB] OR ""hepatitis B virus HBV""[TIAB] OR ""hepatitis B virus""[TIAB]) AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",35214632,10.3390/vaccines10020173,Immunization with GP1 but Not Core-like Particles Displaying Isolated,Vaccines,2022/02/27,,,['Journal Article'],2022

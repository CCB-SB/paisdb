2,"It is known that probiotic microorganisms are able to modulate pathogen virulence. This ability is strain dependent and involves multiple interactions between microorganisms and relevant host's cell populations. In the present work we focus on the effect of a potentially probiotic lactobacillus strain (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis CIDCA 133) in an in vitro model of Bacillus cereus infection. Our results showed that infection of intestinal epithelial HT-29 cells by B. cereus induces nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway. Noteworthy, the presence of strain L. delbrueckii subsp.lactis CIDCA 133 increases stimulation. However, B. cereus-induced interleukin (IL)-8 production by epithelial cells is partially abrogated by L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis CIDCA 133. These findings suggest that signalling pathways other than that of NF-kappaB are involved. In a co-culture system (HT-29 and monocyte-derived dendritic cells), B. cereus was able to translocate from the epithelial (upper) to the dendritic cell compartment (lower). This translocation was partially abrogated by the presence of lactobacilli in the upper compartment. In addition, infection of epithelial cells in the co-culture model, led to an increase in the expression of CD86 by dendritic cells. This effect could not be modified in the presence of lactobacilli. Interestingly, infection of enterocytes with B. cereus triggers production of proinflammatory cytokines by dendritic cells (IL-8, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)). The production of TNF-alpha (a protective cytokine in B. cereus infections) by dendritic cells was increased in the presence of lactobacilli. The present work demonstrates for the first time the effect of L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis CIDCA 133, a potentially probiotic strain, in an in vitro model of B. cereus infection.

4,"To study evolved resistance/tolerance in an insect model, we carried out an experimental evolution study using D. melanogaster and the opportunistic pathogen B. cereus as the agent of selection. The selected lines evolved a 3.0- to 3.3-log increase in the concentration of spores required for 50% mortality after 18-24 generations of selection. In the absence of any treatment, selected lines evolved an increase in egg production and delayed development time. The latter response could be interpreted as a cost of evolution. Alternatively, delayed development might have been a target of selection resulting in increased adult fat body function including production of antimicrobial peptides, and, incidentally, yolk production for oocytes and eggs. When treated with autoclaved spores, the egg production difference between selected and control lines was abolished, and this response was consistent with the hypothesis of a cost of an induced immune response. Treatment with autoclaved spores also reduced life span in some cases and elicited early-age mortality in the selected and wound-control lines both of which were consistent with the hypothesis of a cost associated with induction of immune responses. In general, assays on egg production yielded key outcomes including the negative effect of autoclaved spores on egg production.",Bacillus cereus infection,Melanogaster,"Bacillus cereus infection,Melanogaster","""Bacillus cereus infection""[TIAB] AND ""Melanogaster""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",23094195,10.1155/2012/935970,Drosophila melanogaster Selection for Survival of Bacillus cereus Infection: Life,International journal of evolutionary biology,2012/10/25,,,['Journal Article'],2012

23,"Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. These cancers are the end result of a complex interplay between gene and environment. Bacteria, parasites, and viruses have been implicated in some cancers. Recent data have put at focus the gut microbiome as the key player firing tumorigenesis. Experimental and human studies have provided evidence on the role of microbiota in cancer development. Although subject to changes in different settings such as antibiotic treatment, diet or lifestyle, our microbiome is quite stable and is capable of increasing susceptibility to cancer or decrease and halt its progression. The crucial event in carcinogenesis triggered by microbiome seems to be chronic inflammation influencing the genomic stability of host cells and activating immune mechanisms.

26,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma is preceded by the development of reflux-related intestinal metaplasia or Barrett esophagus, which is a response to inflammation of the esophageal squamous mucosa, reflux esophagitis. Gastroesophageal reflux impairs the mucosal barrier in the distal esophagus, allowing chronic exposure of the squamous epithelium to the diverse microbial ecosystem or microbiome and inducing chronic inflammation. The esophageal microbiome is altered in both esophagitis and Barrett esophagus, characterized by a significant decrease in gram-positive bacteria and an increase in gram-negative bacteria in esophagitis and Barrett esophagus. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a major structure of the outer membrane in gram-negative bacteria, can upregulate gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines via activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 and NF-kappaB pathway. The potential impact of LPS on reflux esophagitis may be through relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter via inducible nitric oxide synthase and by delaying gastric emptying via cyclooxygenase-2. Chronic inflammation may play a critical role in the progression from benign to malignant esophageal disease.

RESULTS: The mentioned organism was able to modulate considerably expression of p53, TNF-alpha and IL-18 in a time-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that microorganism influences expression of carcinogenesis biomarker and cytokines in cell line models and possibility promotes oesophageal adenocarcinoma.",Barrett esophagus,Campylobacter concisus,"Barrett esophagus,Campylobacter concisus","(""Barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett oesophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett ulcer of esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus with esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""ulcerative esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""barretts syndrome""[TIAB]) AND ""Campylobacter concisus""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",26865939,10.5812/jjm.26393,"The Effect of Campylobacter concisus on Expression of IL-18, TNF-alpha and p53 in",Jundishapur journal of microbiology,2016/02/13,,,['Journal Article'],2016
30,"Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) characterized by persistent and recurrent Candida infection of the skin, nails, and the mucosa membranes has been proposed as the major infectious phenotype in patients with gain-of-function mutation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) 1. However, viral infections caused mostly by herpesviruses, and a broad range of autoimmune disorders may also be part of the clinical phenotype. We report here on a 31 years old female patient suffering from severe mucosal aphthous mucositis and ulcers and recurrent herpes simplex for decades. We found a previously unknown heterozygous sequence variant in STAT1 (c.1219C>G; L407V) affecting the DNA-binding domain of the protein in the patient and her 4 years old daughter. We found this mutation gain-of-function (GOF) by using immunoblot and luciferase assays. We detected low proportion of IL-17A-producing CD4+ T cell lymphocytes by using intracellular staining and flow cytometry. Candida-induced secretion of IL-17A and IL-22 by mononuclear cells from the patient was markedly decreased compared to controls. These data suggest that the novel mutant allele may result in impaired differentiation of CD4+ T cells to CD4+/IL-17+ cells. The clinical phenotype of the disease in this patient was unique as it was dominated primarily by severe aphthous stomatitis and ulcerative esophagitis and only partly by typical CMC resulting in diagnostic delay. We suggest that patients with severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis and esophagitis should be evaluated for STAT1 GOF mutation. Based on the broad clinical spectrum of the disease, we also suggest that CMC and CMC disease may not be an appropriate term to define clinically STAT1 GOF mutation.",Barrett esophagus,Candida,"Barrett esophagus,Candida","(""Barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett oesophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett ulcer of esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus with esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""ulcerative esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""barretts syndrome""[TIAB]) AND (""Candida""[TIAB] OR ""Torulopsis""[TIAB]) AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",32547544,10.3389/fimmu.2020.00967,"Recurrent, Severe Aphthous Stomatitis and Mucosal Ulcers as Primary",Frontiers in immunology,2020/06/18,"['Adult', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Candidiasis, Chronic Mucocutaneous/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gain of Function Mutation', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Heredity', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-17/metabolism', 'Interleukins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Family', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Recurrence', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Stomatitis, Aphthous/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Ulcer/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-22']","0 (IL17A protein, human)","['Case Reports', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",2020

However, life-threatening complications, like emphysematous gastritis and gastric perforation have also been described. Gastroparesis and gastric outlet obstruction have been considered as a potential etiologic factor. All pediatric cases described thus far presented with concomitant gastrointestinal pathology, such as Helicobacter pylori gastritis, celiac disease, infection with Giardia lamblia or Candida spp. Here, we report two children with S. ventriculi infection, in whom the diagnosis was established by typical histological findings in mucosal biopsies. The first child presented with hematemesis due to ulcerative esophagitis and gastritis, the second child with a history of esophageal stricture had ulcerative gastritis.

32,"HIV positive patients on ritonavir-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) can develop iatrogenic Cushing syndrome (IACS) and adrenal insufficiency as a result of drug-drug interactions with inhaled or intranasal glucocorticoid therapy. Reports related to epidural triamcinolone injections are relatively uncommon but increasingly reported. We describe a 48-year-old woman with immunologically and virologically well-controlled HIV on ritonavir-based ART, who developed headache, dizziness, and candida and herpes simplex virus (HSV) ulcerative esophagitis 7 days after receiving an epidural triamcinolone injection for cervical radicular pain. Iatrogenic Cushing syndrome and relative adrenal insufficiency were suspected and proven. The patient's ART was changed to a non-HIV protease inhibitor- (PI-) containing program, her symptoms improved, and she did not require hydrocortisone replacement. In this paper, we review the literature on IACS and relative secondary adrenal insufficiency from epidural triamcinolone injections in HIV patients on ritonavir-containing ART regimens.

33,"Progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) causes smooth muscle atrophy and fibrosis of the distal two-thirds of the esophagus. Motility studies show reduced-amplitude or absent peristaltic contractions in this region and normal or decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressure. Patients complain of dysphagia, heartburn, and regurgitation due to reflux and dysmotility. Complications include strictures found in 17% to 29% of patients and Barrett esophagus is 0% to 37%. Candida esophagitis is a complication of PSS not seen with non-PSS reflux. Esophageal disease correlates with pulmonary involvement but not with disease in the stomach or intestines. Whether reflux contributes to the pulmonary disease is an open question. Although manometry is the gold standard for diagnosis, cine-esophagram and scintography are only slightly less sensitive and should be considered for following the patients. Symptoms correlate poorly with evidence of esophagitis or abnormal 24-hour pH recordings. As a result, it is unclear which patients should receive acid-reducing or prokinetic medications and which medication to use. Aspiration precautions are important in those with severe esophageal dysmotility.

34,"OBJECTIVES: Dilated intercellular spaces (DIS) in the esophageal epithelium have been identified by electron microscopy as marker of acid reflux damage in experimental animals and adults with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). We aimed to identify and quantify DIS by light microscopy in pediatric GERD and esophagitis. METHODS: We prospectively took esophageal biopsies in 70 consecutive pediatric patients, 48 of whom had GERD symptoms. On hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections esophagitis was scored histologically, and DIS were graded as 0 (absent), + (small and focal), ++ (moderate) or +++ (large and diffuse). A computerized image analysis identified total, cellular and nuclear areas and DIS were quantified as percentage of total minus cellular area. RESULTS: Forty of 48 GERD patients had histological esophagitis (33 G1, 4 G2, 3 G3, 1 of which with Barrett esophagus), and all 40 had DIS (33 +, 4 ++, 3 +++) with 100% interobserver agreement; 15 of 29 (55%) had abnormal pH study (reflux index, 5.7%-36%). In 30 patients the esophagus was histologically normal. DIS values were 2.21% +/- 2.60% (range, 0.11%-12%) in patients with esophagitis and 0.44% +/- 0.13% (0.2%-0.7%) in patients with normal histology (P < 0.00001), with 0.71% bearing 70% sensitivity and 100% specificity for GERD versus controls. Five other children with esophagitis unrelated to GERD (eosinophilic, Candida, food allergy) also had DIS + to +++, and median DIS area was 5% (1.3%-12%).

Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 and group 2. Group 1 consisted of patients with CKD stages 1-5 and group 2 consisted of renal allograft recipients. All biopsies were reviewed by an experienced pathologist. Clinical data were collected from patient's medical records. RESULTS: There were 38 patients in group 1 and 25 patients in group 2. Twenty-nine out of 38 patients in group 1 presented with upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) evaluation, which showed erosive gastritis as the most common biopsy finding followed by ulcerative esophagitis and duodenitis. These patients were also found to be susceptible to develop ischemic colitis due to hypotensive episodes during dialysis, which are likely to occur during the initial stages of dialysis. The most frequent symptom in group 2 was chronic diarrhea (13 out of 25 patients) for which a colonoscopic examination was done which revealed various infection and drug-related colitis, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) being a major culprit. CONCLUSION: CKD patients with high urea level are prone to develop upper GI symptoms and mostly show erosive gastritis, ulcerative esophagitis, and duodenitis on biopsy. On the contrary, renal allograft recipients mostly develop opportunistic infections and drug-related toxicity in the colon. MMF-related GI toxicity is an underrecognized entity and further prospective studies are required for its better understanding.",Barrett esophagus,Dialysis,"Barrett esophagus,Dialysis","(""Barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett oesophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett ulcer of esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus with esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""ulcerative esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""barretts syndrome""[TIAB]) AND ""Dialysis""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",23078600,10.3109/0886022X.2012.731998,Gastrointestinal complications in patients with chronic kidney disease--a 5-year,Renal failure,2012/10/20,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Intestinal Mucosa/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Morbidity/trends', 'Prognosis', 'Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/*complications/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate/trends', '*Tertiary Care Centers', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",2012

47,"BACKGROUND: There are marked local inconsistencies in the Arabian Peninsula about the role of preoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in bariatric surgery. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the frequency of endoscopic and histological findings in the Saudi population presenting for pre-bariatric surgery evaluation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study that included all the patients who were evaluated by EGD at Dammam Medical Complex, Dammam, Saudi Arabia, between 2018 and 2021 as a part of their pre-bariatric-surgery evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 684 patients were included. They consisted of 250 male and 434 female patients (36.5% and 63.5%, respectively). The mean +/- standard deviation for the patients' age and body mass index (BMI) were 36.4+/-10.6 years and 44.6+/-5.1 kg/m(2), respectively. Significant endoscopic or histopathological findings as defined by the presence of large (>/= 2 cm) hiatus hernia, esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett esophagus, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, or intestinal metaplasia were found in 143 patients (20.9%); 364 patients (53.2%) were diagnosed to have Helicobacter pylori infection. CONCLUSION: The high number of significant endoscopic and histopathological findings in our study supports the routine use of preoperative EGD in all bariatric surgery patients. However, omitting EGD before Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in asymptomatic patients is still reasonable as the most frequently found significant findings, esophagitis, and hiatus hernia, are less likely to impact the operative plans in RYGB.

49,"BACKGROUND: Non-oesophageal gastrointestinal eosinophilic diseases (EGID) are considered rare. However, low disease awareness among clinicians and pathologists may contribute to underdiagnosis. AIMS: To determine how frequently requests to evaluate for EGID accompany gastrointestinal biopsies and in what proportion of suspected cases pathologists address these requests, either confirming or refuting the clinical suspicion. METHODS: All cases in which biopsy requisitions included an explicit suspicion of EGID were extracted from a large clinicopathologic database and manually reviewed for accuracy. The diagnoses for these cases were then analysed to determine whether clinical suspicions were confirmed, refuted or ignored. RESULTS: Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) was suspected in 12.8% of 903,516 patients with biopsies and confirmed in 14.9% of them. A suspicion of eosinophilic gastritis accompanied <0.001% of 1,438,206 gastric biopsy sets and was confirmed in 11.5% of them; eosinophilic duodenitis was suspected in 0.02% of ~675,519 patients with duodenal biopsies and confirmed in 8.0% of these; eosinophilic colitis was mentioned in <0.001% of 2,504,485 patients with colonic biopsies and confirmed in 0.1% of them. Less than 3% of endoscopists mentioned non-oesophageal EGID in the requisition, while most expressed a clinical suspicion of Barrett oesophagus, Helicobacter pylori gastritis, celiac disease and microscopic colitis (in 21.2%, 49.2%, 1% and 6.4% of the cases, respectively).

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(51): 2040-2046. Summary. Before the 1970s, only 1-3% of esophageal cancers were adenocarcinoma. Since the mid-70s, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has shown the greatest increase compared to all other cancer types and overtook squamous carcinoma incidence in the mid-90s in the Western countries. Today, the relative incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in Hungary is 34.7% and around 60% in the Western countries. Some risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma have been identified such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's esophagus, obesity, smoking and decreased prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection, but these risk factors were already present before the 70s. The prevalence of obesity and the consequentially developed gastroesophageal reflux has doubled during the last 40 years, but it does not explain alone the dramatic rise in the esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence. The H2 blockers, as new effective antisecretory medication, were introduced in 1976, coinciding in time with the substantial rise of esophageal adenocarcinoma. According to the DeMeester theory, the change in the pH of gastric refluxate caused by acid suppression enhances its carcinogenic potential. There are a lot of controversies among the prevention, etiology and treatment of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, especially regarding the long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), an even more effective group of acid suppressors. The effectiveness of PPIs has led to an overuse exceeding its regular indications with little benefit, exposing patients to a number of potential risks. In conclusion, in the dramatic rise of the esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence, obesity accompanied by reflux disease and the decreased incidence of H. pylori infection certainly play important roles. The introduction of modern antisecretory drugs in the treatment of acid-related diseases promoting carcinogenesis, arises as a new consideration.

51,"Routine preoperative endoscopic evaluation for bariatric surgery is controversial; however, for patients undergoing endoscopy, some findings may alter surgical management. Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is found in up to 11.7% of the general population. When associated with determined risk factors, GIM has a risk of progressing to gastric cancer. The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of GIM and possible associated factors in those undergoing bariatric surgery. We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent primary sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at our institution between January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2020. Baseline characteristics and preoperative endoscopic findings were obtained from all patients. Histopathologic analysis of sleeve gastrectomy specimens was reviewed. We identified 753 patients. Mean (SD) age and body mass index were 49.0 (13.1) years and 43.9 (7.1) kg/m(2), respectively. Procedures consisted of 411 (54.6%) gastric bypasses and 342 (45.4%) sleeve gastrectomies. Esophagitis and Barrett esophagus were found in 18.1% and 5.0% of patients, respectively. Preoperative gastric biopsy identified Helicobacter pylori in 6.4% and GIM in 2.7%.

52,"Chronic acid-biliary reflux and Helicobacter pylori infection are instrumental environmental drivers of cancer initiation and progression in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Remarkably, although these environmental carcinogens are quite dissimilar, the tumour progression cascade these carcinogens engender is highly comparable. For this reason, studies of malignant progression occurring at the anatomic borderland between the oesophagus and the stomach have traditionally lumped junctional adenocarcinomas with either oesophageal adenocarcinoma or gastric adenocarcinoma. Whilst studies have revealed remarkable epidemiological and genetic similarities of these cancers and their associated premalignant conditions, these works have also revealed some key differences. This highlights that further scientific effort demands a dedicated focus on the understanding of the cell-cell interaction between the epithelium and the local microenvironment in this anatomic region.

53,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: A role for Helicobacter pylori in triggering systemic sclerosis (SSc) has been proposed, but data are conflicting. In previous studies, infection has been generally searched for by using serology. We designed this study to assess H. pylori prevalence in SSc patients with histology of gastric mucosa, considered the criterion standard for infection diagnosis. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 30 SSc patients who complained of upper gastrointestinal symptoms. All underwent upper endoscopy with gastric biopsies. Endoscopic alterations were recorded, and gastric mucosa biopsies were used for both histological examination and searching for H. pylori. The role for proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy was considered. Fisher exact test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Data of 28 SSc patients were available, 14 with ongoing PPI therapy. Helicobacter pylori infection at histology was detected in 14.3% patients, and it equally occurred in patients with or without PPI therapy. Erosive esophagitis/Barrett esophagus was detected in 26.6% of cases. Among patients with PPI therapy, 30% received half dose only. The prevalence of intestinal metaplasia was low (14.3%). Endoscopic esophageal alterations were significantly more frequent in those patients showing anti-Scl70 antibody positivity. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that prevalence of H. pylori is very low in SSc patients, so that it seems not having a role in triggering SSc.

54,"BACKGROUND: Older adults are particularly vulnerable to complications from proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs. We sought to characterize the prevalence of potentially low-value PPI prescriptions among older adults to inform a quality improvement (QI) intervention. METHODS: We created a cohort of patients, aged 65 years or older, receiving primary care at a large academic health system in 2018. We identified patients currently prescribed any PPI using the electronic health record (EHR) medication list (current defined as September 1, 2018). A geriatrician, a gastroenterologist, a QI expert, and two primary care physicians (PCPs) created multidisciplinary PPI appropriateness criteria based on evidenced-based guidelines. Supervised by a gastroenterologist and PCP, two internal medicine residents conducted manual chart reviews in a random sample of 399 patients prescribed PPIs. We considered prescriptions potentially low value if they lacked a guideline-based (1) short-term indication (gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD]/peptic ulcer disease/Helicobacter pylori gastritis/dyspepsia) or (2) long-term (>8 weeks) indication (severe/refractory GERD/erosive esophagitis/Barrett esophagus/esophageal adenocarcinoma/esophageal stricture/high gastrointestinal bleeding risk/Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). We used the Wilson score method to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on low-value PPI prescription prevalence. RESULTS: Among 69 352 older adults, 8729 (12.6%) were prescribed a PPI. In the sample of 399 patients prescribed PPIs, 63.9% were female; their mean age was 76.2 years, and they were seen by 169 PCPs. Of the 399 prescriptions, 143 (35.8%; 95% CI = 31.3%-40.7%) were potentially low value-of which 82% began appropriately (eg, GERD) but then continued long term without a guideline-based indication. Among 169 PCPs, 32 (18.9%) contributed to 59.2% of potentially low-value prescriptions. CONCLUSION: One in eight older adults were prescribed a PPI, and over one-third of prescriptions were potentially low-value. Most often, appropriate short-term prescriptions became potentially low value because they lacked long-term indications. With most potentially low-value prescribing concentrated among a small subset of PCPs, interventions targeting them and/or applying EHR-based automatic stopping rules may protect older adults from harm.

55,"Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been in use since the early 1990s and play a crucial role in the management of a number of conditions affecting the upper gastrointestinal tract, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett esophagus, eosinophilic esophagitis, and dyspepsia. PPIs also play an important role in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection and in the prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract ulcers and bleeding among patients taking antiplatelet therapy and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Despite recent concerns regarding the long-term safety of PPIs, their risk-benefit profiles strongly favor their appropriate use in patients who have genuine indications for them.

56,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Esophageal motor disorder (EMD) has been shown to be associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, the association of EMD with a Barrett's esophagus (BE) is controversial. Our objective was to evaluate whether the presence of EMD was an independent factor associated with BE. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was conducted in GERD patients who all had oeso-gastroduodenal endoscopy and high-resolution esophageal manometry. The clinical data collected was known or potential risk factors for BE: male gender, smoking and alcohol consumption, age, body mass index, presence of hiatal hernia, frequency, and age of GERD. EMD were classified according to the Chicago classification into: ineffective motor syndrome, fragmented peristalsis and absence of peristalsis, lower esophageal sphincter hypotonia. RESULTS: Two hundred and one patients (101 in the GERD + BE group and 100 in the GERD without BE) were included. In univariate analysis, male gender, alcohol consumption, presence of hiatal hernia, and EMD appeared to be associated with the presence of BE. In a multivariate analysis, 3 independent factors were identified: the presence of EMD (odds ratio [OR], 3.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.71-9.28; P = 0.001), the presence of hiatal hernia (OR, 5.60; 95% CI, 2.45-12.76; P ＜ 0.001), Helicobacter pylori infection (OR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01-0.84; P = 0.035).

58,"Helicobacter pylori is an important human pathogen, associated with a substantial burden from both malignant and non-malignant diseases. The bacterium is classed as a human carcinogen, being strongly linked with gastric cancer, the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide and is also associated with common conditions such as dyspepsia and peptic ulcer. Eradication of H. pylori reduces the incidence of gastric cancer and peptic ulcer, as well as the prevalence and costs of managing dyspepsia. Economic analyses suggest that eradication of H. pylori as a means of controlling gastric cancer is cost-effective in high-risk populations. Even in populations at low risk of gastric cancer, there might be other benefits arising from screening and treatment, owing to the effects on non-malignant upper gastrointestinal diseases. However, public health authorities have been slow to consider the benefits of population-based screening and treatment as a means of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with the infection. There are also concerns about widespread use of eradication therapy, including antimicrobial resistance and a rise in the prevalence of diseases that are negatively associated with H. pylori, such as GERD, Barrett oesophagus, asthma and obesity.

59,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is rapidly increasing in incidence in many Western societies, requires demanding treatment, and is associated with a poor prognosis, therefore preventive measures are highly warranted. To assess the opportunities for prevention, we reviewed the available literature and identified seven main potentially preventive targets. Preventive effects were found on the basis of medium-level observational evidence following treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (using both medication and surgery) and tobacco smoking cessation, which should be clinically recommended among exposed patients. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs appear to prevent EAC, and the limited existing data also indicate a protective effect of medication with statins or hormone replacement therapy in women, but current evidence is insufficient to guide clinical decision-making regarding these drugs. The evidence is presently insufficient to assess the potentially preventive role of weight loss. Whether avoidance of eradication of Helicobacter pylori prevents EAC is not studied, but there is no evidence that such eradication increases symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux or prevalence of erosive esophagitis. The introduction of preventive actions should be tailored toward high-risk individuals, that is, older men with obesity and gastroesophageal reflux disease and individuals with Barrett esophagus rather than the population at large.

60,"Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. These cancers are the end result of a complex interplay between gene and environment. Bacteria, parasites, and viruses have been implicated in some cancers. Recent data have put at focus the gut microbiome as the key player firing tumorigenesis. Experimental and human studies have provided evidence on the role of microbiota in cancer development. Although subject to changes in different settings such as antibiotic treatment, diet or lifestyle, our microbiome is quite stable and is capable of increasing susceptibility to cancer or decrease and halt its progression. The crucial event in carcinogenesis triggered by microbiome seems to be chronic inflammation influencing the genomic stability of host cells and activating immune mechanisms. Infection-related cancers represent 5.5% of the global cancer burden. Chronic inflammation predisposes to cancer in various GI organs, including hepatocellular carcinoma caused by hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus-related chronic hepatitis, gastric cancer (GC) caused by Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis, colorectal cancer caused by inflammatory bowel disease, bile duct cancer by primary sclerosing cholangitis, and esophageal cancer caused by Barrett esophagus.

61,"INTRODUCTION: Given the difficulty in accessing to the excluded stomach after gastric bypass and the increase in gastroesophageal reflux after sleeve gastrectomy, it is justified to perform a preoperative fibrogastroscopy.The influence of the fibrogastroscopy (FGS) findings in the therapeutic approach is analyzed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of preoperative FGS findings is performed, from 04/06 to 12/12. The influence of the FGS results on the surgical technique selection, in the endoscopic or medical treatment and its relation to gastric fistula is analyzed by means of multivariate regression (confounding factors: Age, body mass index, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, antiplatelet therapy, surgical technique (bariatric surgery, sleeve gastrectomy). RESULTS: Three hundred thirty one patients are included: 32.6% biopsy of gastric lesion; 27% gastritis; 18.1% hiatal hernia; 3% metaplasia; 0.6% Barrett esophagus; 2.1% esophagitis; 0.3% dysplasia; 0.3 Schatzky&#180;s ring; 1.5% incompetent cardia; 2.4% duodenitis; 0.3% gastric erosions; 0.6% gastric xanthoma; 1.8%, gastric polyp; 1.6% duodenal ulcer; 0.6% papulo-erosive gastritis; 0.6% esophageal papilloma; 0.3% submucosal tumor.

62,"Common questions that arise regarding treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) include which medications are most effective, when surgery may be indicated, which patients should be screened for Barrett esophagus and Helicobacter pylori infection, and which adverse effects occur with these medications. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective medical therapy, and all PPIs provide similar relief of GERD symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to recommend testing for H. pylori in patients with GERD. In the absence of alarm symptoms, endoscopy is not necessary to make an initial diagnosis of GERD. Patients with alarm symptoms require endoscopy. Screening for Barrett esophagus is not routinely recommended, but may be considered in white men 50 years or older who have had GERD symptoms for at least five years.

63,"The incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma has increased dramatically in the developed world in the last half century. Over approximately the same period there has been an increase in the prevalence of obesity. Multiple epidemiological studies and meta-analyses have confirmed that obesity, especially abdominal, visceral obesity, is a risk factor for gastro-oesophageal reflux, Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Although visceral obesity enhances gastro-oesophageal reflux, the available data also show that visceral obesity increases the risk of Barrett's oesophagus and adenocarcinoma via reflux-independent mechanisms. Several possible mechanisms could link obesity with the risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma in addition to mechanical effects increasing reflux. These include reduced gastric Helicobacter pylori infection, altered intestinal microbiome, factors related to lifestyle, the metabolic syndrome and associated low-grade inflammation induced by obesity and the secretion of mediators by adipocytes which may directly influence the oesophageal epithelium. Of these adipocyte-derived mediators, increased leptin levels have been independently associated with progression to oesophageal adenocarcinoma and in laboratory studies leptin enhances malignant behaviours in cell lines. Adiponectin is also secreted by adipocytes and levels decline with obesity: decreased serum adiponectin levels are associated with malignant progression in Barrett's oesophagus and experimentally adiponectin exerts anticancer effects in Barrett's cell lines and inhibits growth factor signalling. At present there are no proven chemopreventative interventions that may reduce the incidence of obesity-associated oesophageal cancer: observational studies suggest that the combined use of a statin and aspirin or another cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor is associated with a significantly reduced cancer incidence in patients with Barrett's oesophagus.",Barrett esophagus,Helicobacter,"Barrett esophagus,Helicobacter","(""Barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett oesophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett ulcer of esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus with esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""ulcerative esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""barretts syndrome""[TIAB]) AND ""Helicobacter""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",25364384,10.1177/1756283X14538689,The role of obesity in oesophageal cancer development.,Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology,2014/11/05,,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",2014
64,"Guidelines have been published regarding the management of Barrett's oesophagus (columnar-lined oesophagus). These have examined the role of surveillance in an effort to detect dysplasia and early cancer. The guidelines have provided criteria for enrolment into surveillance and some risk stratification with regard to surveillance interval. The research basis for the decisions reached with regard to cancer risk is weak and this manuscript has examined the available data published from meta-analyses up to 25(th) April 2013 (much of which has been published since the guidelines and their most recent updates have been written). There were 9 meta-analyses comparing patients with Barrett's oesophagus to control populations. These have demonstrated that Barrett's oesophagus is more common in males than females, in subjects who have ever smoked, in subjects with obesity, in subjects with prolonged symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, in subjects who do not have infection with Helicobacter pylori and in subjects with hiatus hernia. These findings should inform public health measures in reducing the risk of Barrett's oesophagus and subsequent surveillance burden and cancer risk. There were 8 meta-analyses comparing different groups of patients with Barrett's oesophagus with regard to cancer risk. These have demonstrated that there was no statistically significant benefit of antireflux surgery over medical therapy, that endoscopic ablative therapy was effective in reducing cancer risk that there was similar cancer risk in patients with Barrett's oesophagus independent of geographic origin, that the adenocarcinoma incidence in males is twice the rate in females, that the cancer risk in long segment disease showed a trend to be higher than in short segment disease, that there was a trend for higher cancer risk in low-grade dysplasia over non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus, that there is a lower risk in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection and that there is a significant protective effect of aspirin and statins. There were no meta-analyses examining the role of intestinal metaplasia. These results demonstrate that guidance regarding surveillance based on the presence of intestinal metaplasia, segment length and the presence of low-grade dysplasia has a weak basis, and further consideration should be given to gender and helicobacter status, ablation of the metaplastic segment as well as the chemoprotective role of aspirin and statins.",Barrett esophagus,Helicobacter,"Barrett esophagus,Helicobacter","(""Barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett oesophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett ulcer of esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus with esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""ulcerative esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""barretts syndrome""[TIAB]) AND ""Helicobacter""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",25133020,10.4291/wjgp.v5.i3.178,Barrett's oesophagus: Evidence from the current meta-analyses.,World journal of gastrointestinal pathophysiology,2014/08/19,,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",2014
65,"Dong Y, Qi B, Feng XY, Jiang CM. Meta-analysis of Barrett's esophagus in China. World J Gastroenterol 2013;19(46):8770-8779 The disease pattern of Barrett's esophagus (BE) in China is poorly characterised particularly in comparison with other developed countries. This meta-analysis of 3873 cases of BE collated from 69 clinical studies conducted in 25 provinces between 2000 and 2011 investigated the epidemiology and characteristics of BE in China compared to Western countries. The total endoscopic detection rate of BE was 1.0% (95%CI: 0.1%-1.8%) with an average patient age of 49.07 +/- 5.09 years, lower than many Western countries.The authors postulate this may be attributed to environmental risk factor variation, distinct genetics and different medical practice including diagnostic criteria for BE and expertise in endoscopy. This study identified a 1.781 male predominancefor BE in China, consistent with Western reports. Short-segment BE accounted for 80.3% of cases with island type and cardiac type the most common endoscopic (44.8%) and histological (40.0%) manifestations respectively. Of the 1283 BE cases followed up for three to 36 months the incidence of esophageal cancer was 1.418 per 1000 person-years, lower than the incidence reported in Western countries. Lee HS, Jeon SW. Barrett esophagus in Asia: same disease with different pattern. ClinEndosc 2014;47(1):15-22 Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a common, pre-cancerous condition characterised by intestinal metaplasia of squamous esophageal epithelium usually attributed to chronic gastric acid exposure. This review article explores important differences in the disease pattern of BE between Asian and the Western countries. Overall the prevalence of BE is lower in Asia compared to the West with a greater proportion of short-segment type. The authors identify great variability in the endoscopic and pathologic diagnostic criteria for BE. Many of the studies in Asian countries did not use a standardised four-quadrant biopsy protocol which may have led to an underestimation of BE prevalence. The review highlights an increasing incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in the West but unclear disease trend in Asia with inter-country variability. Similarly in Asian and Western countries BE is associated with the presence of hiatus hernia, advancing age, male gender, alcohol consumption, smoking, abdominal obesity and longer duration of gastro-esophageal reflux disease. The authors postulate that Helicobacter pylori infection, more prevalent in Asia than the West, may have a protective effect on BE. There is a need for larger, prospective studies to further clarify the disease pattern of BE in Asian countries. Clearly standardisation of the diagnostic process for BE is important to validate the differences in disease trends between Asian and Western countries. Kiadaliri AA. Gender and social disparities in esophagus cancer incidence in Iran, 2003-2009: a time trend province-level study.Asian Pac J Cancer Prev 2014;15(2):623-7 Esophageal cancer (EC) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality particuarly in Iran where the incidence rate exceeds the global average. An understanding of the factors influencing the province-specific incidence of EC in Iran is important to inform disease-prevention strategies and address health inequalities. This ecological study used cancer registry data to investigate the relationship between gender and social class and the incidence of EC in Iran at province-level between 2003 and 2009. The age standardised incidence rates (ASIR) of EC were greatest in the Northern provinces of Iran, specifically Razavi Khorasan in males and Kordestan in females. Overall the EC incidence did not significantly differ according to gender. Interestingly, during the study period the ASIR increased by 4.6% per year in females (p=0.08) and 6.5% per year in males (p=0.02). This may reflect increasing rates of establised risk factors for EC including obsesity and gastro-esophageal reflux disease alongside more vigilant recording of new cases. Social class was inversely associated with the ASIR of EC regardless of gender which may be attributed to class differences in risk factor distribution particularly smoking, diet and obesity. An appreciation for the limitations of an epidemiological study is important when interpreting results which should be further evaluated in future studies. Islami F et al.Determinants of gastroesophageal reflux disease, including hookah smoking and opium use- A cross-sectional analysis of 50,000 individuals. PLoS One 2014;9(2):e89256 Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a highly prevalent cause of gastrointestinal symptoms worldwide incurring great cost to the primary and secondary healthcare sectors. An improved understanding of the factors which influence GERD symptoms in low- to medium- income countries may inform public health initiatives. This study analysed prospective data from the Golestan cohort study, primarily established to investigate determinants of upper gastrointestinal cancers, toexplore the risk factors influencing GERD symptoms (regurgitation and/or heartburn) in 50,045 individuals aged 40-75 years in Golestan Province, Iran enrolled between 01/2004 and 06/2008.Of note, 39.12% of individuals denied ever experiencing GERD symptoms. A further 19.89% reported at least once weekly GERD symptoms with 11.83% experiencing daily symptoms. Severe symptoms, defined as disturbing daily work or sleep, were recorded by 11.33% of individuals. Separately the occurrence of daily GERD symptoms and severe symptoms were inversely associated with male gender (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.33-0.39 both), level of formal education (p=0.01 and p=0.001 respectively), wealth score (p<0.001 both) and regular nass chewing (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.98 and OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76-0.99 respectively)and were positively associated with body mass index (p<0.001 both), intensity of physical activity (p=0.04 both), cigarette pack years (p<0.001 both), alcohol consumption (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.13-1.64 and OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.28-1.83 respectively) and opium use (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.67-1.99 and OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.55-1.87 respectively).In addition hookah smoking had a borderline significant correlation with mild and moderate severity GERD symptoms in individuals who had never smoked cigarettes (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.00-1.99 and OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.99-1.57 respectively). Overall this large study contributes useful data to inform the prevention and management of GERD symptoms particularly regarding the use of hookah, opium and nass which was previously unclear. Barbera M et al. The human squamous oesophagus has widespread capacity for clonal expansion from cells at diverse stages of differentiation. Gut 2014;0:1-9. doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2013-306171 Current knowledge on human esophageal tissue homeostasis and injury repair is derived predominantly from murine models and hence may be inaccurate due to cellular and architectural differences. This study used 3D imaging in conjunction withstaining for cell lineage markers to investigate the cellular mechanisms involved in homeostasis of the normal human squamous esophagus in 10 participants undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. The self-renewal potential of cell subpopulations was also assessed using in vitro and in vivo assays. A decreasing gradient of cell proliferation was observed from the inter-papillary basal layer to the tip of the papilla where there was no evidence of mitosis. The expression ofbeta1-integrin, a putative stem cell marker, was consistent throughout the basal layer and therefore the entire basal layer can be considered undifferentiated. Quiescent beta1-integrin/CD34-positive cells which failed to stain for CD45, S-100 or F4-80were identified at the tip of the papilla suggesting this is an extension of the basal layer. Contrary to previous data, this study found progenitor cells widely distributed in human esophageal tissue and included already differentiated epithelial cells. This insight into esophageal homeostasis may inform future studies exploring the pathological mechanisms underpinning homeostatic disruption in disease states such as Barrett's esophagus.

66,"Barrett esophagus (BE) is considered to develop as a result of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and to predispose to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). However, the disease pattern of BE in Asia differs from that observed in the West. For example, in the West, the prevalence rates of BE and EAC have progressively increased, whereas although the prevalence rate of GERD is increasing in Asia, the prevalence rates of BE and EAC have remained low in most Asian countries.

67,"Answer questions and earn CME/CNE Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is characterized by 6 striking features: increasing incidence, male predominance, lack of preventive measures, opportunities for early detection, demanding surgical therapy and care, and poor prognosis. Reasons for its rapidly increasing incidence include the rising prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux and obesity, combined with the decreasing prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection. The strong male predominance remains unexplained, but hormonal influence might play an important role. Future prevention might include the treatment of reflux or obesity or chemoprevention with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or statins, but no evidence-based preventive measures are currently available. Likely future developments include endoscopic screening of better defined high-risk groups for EAC. Individuals with Barrett esophagus might benefit from surveillance, at least those with dysplasia, but screening and surveillance strategies need careful evaluation to be feasible and cost-effective. The surgery for EAC is more extensive than virtually any other standard procedure, and postoperative survival, health-related quality of life, and nutrition need to be improved (eg, by improved treatment, better decision-making, and more individually tailored follow-up). Promising clinical developments include increased survival after preoperative chemoradiotherapy, the potentially reduced impact on health-related quality of life after minimally invasive surgery, and the new endoscopic therapies for dysplastic Barrett esophagus or early EAC.

68,"OBJECTIVE: Barrett's esophagus (BO) is a precursor of esophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC), a cancer with a poor prognosis and an increasing incidence. Hence there is an interest in mapping causal factors underlying BO and finding strategies to reduce the risk of dysplasia progression in patients with BO. Here we review current knowledge on established as well as less risk factors for the development of BO. Additionally, we summarize today's status on the use of chemoprevention aiming to reduce the risk of cancer progression in BO patients. METHODS: We searched Medline and the Cochrane Library using the MeSH terms ""Barrett's esophagus"" and ""Barrett esophagus,"" both alone and combined with the terms ""risk factor,"" ""aetiology,"" ""diet,"" or ""prevention."" Focus was on original contributions, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. RESULTS: Established risk factors for the development of BO include gastro-esophageal reflux, obesity, male gender, Caucasian ethnicity, and increasing age. Smoking might increase the risk of BO, while aspirin/NSAIDs, Helicobacter pylori infection, and specific ""healthy"" dietary factors may lower the risk. The potential value of using chemoprevention with proton pump inhibitors, aspirin/NSAIDs, or statins is still uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: There is today a substantial knowledge of risk factors of BO.

69,"AIMS: To compare the clinical and pathological features of gastro-oesophageal junction (GEJ) carcinomas in Chinese and American patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty consecutive patients with a GEJ carcinoma (43 from mainland China, and 37 from the USA) were evaluated for association with Barrett oesophagus (BO), chronic Helicobacter pylori gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and outcome. GEJ carcinomas were defined as tumours that were located within 20 mm of, and crossed, the GEJ. Overall, GEJ carcinomas from Chinese patients revealed significantly more frequent location in the proximal stomach, higher pathological stage, larger size, younger patient age, and association with chronic H. pylori gastritis. In contrast, GEJ cancers from American patients showed a strong association with distal oesophageal location, BO, and associated intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia. Pathologically, GEJ carcinomas from American patients were predominantly adenocarcinomas, whereas Chinese patients showed a higher proportion of mucinous, adenosquamous, acinar or neuroendocrine tumours. Overall, 3- and 5-year survival rates were statistically similar between both patient groups, but upon multivariate analysis, Chinese patients showed statistically better survival rates for stage III tumours.

70,"Benign serrated polyps are commonly found in the colorectum but have rarely been described in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. We report a series of 9 serrated polyps arising in the duodenum with clinicopathologic features, immunohistochemical expression profile of mucins (MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6), and molecular analysis for BRAF and KRAS. The polyps were diagnosed as incidental endoscopy findings in 9 different patients, comprising 3 male and 6 female patients, with a mean age of 52.2 years (range, 21-72 years). The second part of the duodenum was the most common site (n = 5), followed by the ampulla (n = 1) and the distal duodenum (n = 1), with the location of the 2 remaining polyps unspecified. Other upper gastrointestinal tract pathology features included Barrett esophagus for 5 patients, Helicobacter gastritis for 1 patient, and mild chronic gastritis for 1 patient. The histologic appearance of the polyps was similar to microvesicular hyperplastic polyp in the colorectum. Immunostaining for mucins showed MUC6 expression in the crypt bases of all polyps, MUC5AC expression in 8 cases (89%), and mucin 2 expression in 6 cases (67%). Molecular testing was successful in 6 polyps, showing BRAF mutation (V600E) in 2 polyps, KRAS mutation in 2 polyps, and no mutation for either gene in 2 polyps. Colonoscopy reports were available for 6 patients, of whom 4 were diagnosed with hyperplastic polyps or sessile serrated polyps in the colorectum.

71,"Ethnic differences in the prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and its complications, including Barrett's oesophagus (BO), are well described in multiracial Asian patient populations. These findings together with familial aggregation of GORD symptoms and twin studies suggest the possibility of a genetic component to GORD. Nevertheless, environmental factors, e.g. Helicobacter pylori infection, abdominal adiposity and metabolic syndrome, could equally account for these differences. Indian (South Asian) race is a risk factor for Barrett' oesophagus. This may be related to the Caucasian genetic make-up of Indians as opposed to an Oriental one as is the case of most other Asians. The HLA-B07 gene commonly found in South Asian and Caucasian populations, but not Orientals, may confer an increased risk for BO. Nevertheless, the high prevalence of H. pylori in South Asians and the consequent atrophic gastritis and hypochlorhydria may partially ameliorate this genetic predisposition to BO. The higher prevalence of obesity and the metabolic syndrome amongst certain Asiatic races may also contribute to the observed increased risk for BO. Future research should target the search for GORD/BO genes, ethnic differences in parietal cell mass and hiatal hernia, H. pylori colonization factors (e.g. MUC1 and MUC2) and adhesion molecules (BabA). Racial differences in lifestyle factors, i.e. abdominal adiposity, consumption of fruit and vegetables as well as smoking, should all be investigated as potential causes for this interethnic variation in GORD and BO.

72,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Rome III criteria has modified the description of functional dyspepsia (FD) and divided this into subgroups. However, the discriminative value of Rome III questionnaire-based diagnosis of FD is yet to be determined. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the Rome III questionnaire for the diagnosis of FD and whether it can discriminate between postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) in patients with dyspeptic symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients, who were not on proton pump inhibitors (PPI), were asked to participate. Patients who have previously established acid peptic disease or predominantly reflux symptoms or having alarm symptoms such as weight loss and hematemesis were excluded. Rome III questionnaire for FD was used to identify the patients as having FD and divide into its subgroups; PDS or EPS. Gastro-duodenal biopsies, liver function tests and ultrasound were done to establish the diagnosis of FD. RESULTS: Out of 272 patients with upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms without alarm features, who were enrolled in the study, a total of 191 (70%) fulfilled the criteria of FD based upon Rome III questionnaire. EPS subgroup was found in 109 (57%), PDS in 17 (9%) patients, overlap between EPS and PDS was present in 56 (29%) patients. Nine (5%) patients remained indeterminate. Diagnosis of FD was established in 136/191 (71%) patients only. Gastritis was present in 116 patients (85%), Duodenitis in 44 (32%) and Helicobacter pylori infection in 70 (51%) patients. Among 55 patients (29%) who had organic diseases, EPS was seen in 35 (64%), PDS in 5 (9%) and overlap in 15 (27%) patients. Underlying organic causes were gastric or duodenal ulcers in 14 patients, Barrett esophagus in five, chronic liver disease in seven, gall stones in five, Giardiasis and celiac disease in three each. Gastric carcinoma, Crohns disease and gastric polyps were seen in one patient each. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that 30% of patients who fulfilled the Rome III criteria for FD actually had organic disease. Almost one-third of patients with functional dyspepsia did not qualify for one of the two subgroups of FD of Rome III.

73,"The present definition of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is based on clinical criteria that are difficult to reproduce accurately. This study provides a method to develop a histologic definition of GERD based on biopsies obtained from the affected esophagus. Pathology reports from 1655 patients who had upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy according to a systematic protocol were reviewed. Biopsies were obtained from the esophagus, around the gastroesophageal junction and the stomach: proximal, body, and antrum. Patients who had oxyntocardiac+/-cardiac+/-intestinal epithelia between the squamous epithelium proximally and the proximal limit of gastric oxyntic mucosa distally were defined as having a squamo-oxyntic gap. The length of the squamo-oxyntic gap varied from less than 1 cm in 1399 (84.5%) patients to greater than 5 cm in 80 (4.8%) of the patients. Only oxyntocardiac epithelium was seen in 190 (11.5%) of the patients, oxyntocardiac and cardiac epithelia in 898 (54.3%), and intestinal metaplasia in addition to the other 2 epithelial types in 567 (34.2%). The prevalence of intestinal metaplasia was directly proportional to length of the squamo-oxyntic gap, being 24.3% (340/1399) when the length was <1 cm, and 83.5% (147/176) with length 1 to 5 cm. All patients with a length more than 5 cm had intestinal metaplasia. The distribution of the 3 epithelia was constant irrespective of the length of the squamocolumnar gap; intestinal metaplasia, when present, was seen maximally in the proximal region of the gap, cardiac epithelium intermediate and oxyntocardiac epithelium in the most distal segment of the gap. The squamo-oxyntic gap started in a dilated region distal to the end of the tubular esophagus and distal to the proximal limit of the rugal folds and extended into the tubular esophagus. Distal gastric biopsies showed no evidence of significant inflammation, intestinal metaplasia or Helicobacter pylori infection in 1543 (93.2%) of the patients, indicating that the squamo-oxyntic gap was largely independent of gastric pathology. We provide evidence that the squamo-oxyntic gap is equivalent to the columnar-lined esophagus. Its presence is a specific and sensitive indicator of reflux and can be used as a cellular criterion to define GERD. The length of the squamo-oxyntic gap provides an accurate assessment of the severity of chronic GERD. The distal limit of the squamo-oxyntic gap, which is the junction between oxyntocardiac and gastric oxyntic epithelium is the true gastroesophageal junction.

74,"BACKGROUND: The role of Barrett esophagus in carcinogenesis is widely accepted, but the significance of esophageal columnar mucosa without histological intestinal metaplasia, known as columnar-lined esophagus, is debated. MATERIAL/METHODS: We studied 128 patients free of Helicobacter pylori with reflux-related symptoms and columnar mucosa in the esophagus at endoscopy, 106 patients with Barrett esophagus (referred to as the Barrett group) and 22 patients without intestinal metaplasia (columnar group). Samples from 20 subjects free of H. pylori were used as controls. Immunostaining for keratin 7 (KRT7), keratin 20 (KRT20), caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), mucin 2, oligomeric mucus/gel-forming (MUC2), and tumor protein p53 (TP53) was assessed. RESULTS: Samples taken 1 cm above the gastroesophageal junction showed KRT7 staining in all cases in the Barrett and columnar groups and none in the control group. Immunostaining for TP53 was absent in the control group, and more frequent in the columnar group (7, 31.8%) compared with the Barrett group (14, 13.2%, P=0.033). In the columnar group, low grade dysplasia and TP53 expression was seen in 7 of 22 biopsy specimens (31.8%) at baseline and in 4 additional specimens after 2 years, for a total of 11 specimens (50.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The expression of KRT7 might help to explain the pathological, reflux-related nature of columnar-lined esophagus, as aberrant expression in a very early stage of the multistep Barrett esophagus progression.

75,"INTRODUCTION: After a partial resection of the stomach, the continuity of the gastrointestinal tract can be restored either by a Billroth II gastrojejunal anastomosis or a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy. Each procedure has its advantages and disadvantages. OBJECTIVE: To determine through a prospective and random clinical trial, the clinical outcome and the endoscopic and histologic alterations of the distal esophagus and the gastric remnant in patients who received a partial distal gastrectomy due to duodenal ulcers and a Billroth II or Roux-en-Y reconstruction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective random trial, a total of 75 patients with duodenal ulcers were included. A bilateral selective vagotomy and partial distal gastrectomy were performed in all patients. A Billroth II or Roux-en-Y 60-cm-long loop was randomly used for reconstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. During the latest follow-up clinical evaluation, upper endoscopy and biopsy samples from the distal esophagus and gastric remnant were obtained. RESULTS: There was 1 operative mortality and 6 patients had some morbidity. The average follow-up period was 15.5 years (range, 11-21). Patients with Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy were significantly more asymptomatic and had greater Visick I grading than patients with Billroth II reconstruction (P < 0.001). In the distal esophagus, endoscopic findings were normal in 90% of the Roux-en-Y group, but only in 51% of the Billroth II group (P < 0.0009). Nearly 25% of the latter group had the appearance of a short-segment Barrett esophagus compared with 3% of the Roux-en-Y group (P < 0.0001). The gastric remnant endoscopic findings were normal in 100% of the Roux-en-Y group and in 18% of the Billroth II group (P < 0.02). Histologic analyses showed similar proportions of normal fundic mucosa and chronic active fundic gastritis. However, chronic atrophic fundic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia were significantly more frequent after Billroth II reconstruction (P < 0.008). Helicobacter pylorus was present in a similar proportion of patients.

76,BACKGROUND/AIMS: The purpose of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in gastroesophageal reflux disease is to detect the complications; both Barrett esophagus and erosive esophagitis are common in developed countries. We aimed to investigate the ratio of esophageal complications in gastroesophageal reflux disease and the relationship between reflux symptoms and erosive esophagitis. METHODS: Six hundred forty-five consecutive adult patients presenting to the Reflux Outpatient Clinic were evaluated prospectively. One hundred sixty patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and who complained of heartburn or regurgitation occurring at least weekly were selected. The complaints and general features of patients were queried via a detailed questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (17%) had endoscopic evidence of erosive esophagitis. Barrett esophagus was found in 3 patients (2%). Neither esophageal stricture nor adenocarcinoma was found. Esophagitis was low grade (grades A and B) in 25 of the 27 (92%) with erosive esophagitis. Patients with erosive esophagitis consumed less alcohol than patients with non-erosive reflux disease. No difference was found between the severity of symptoms in patients with erosive esophagitis and non-erosive reflux disease. CONCLUSIONS: Barrett esophagus and erosive esophagitis were less common compared to the literature although the study was conducted in a tertiary reference center for gastroesophageal reflux disease. The presence of severe symptoms in gastroesophageal reflux disease is not an indication for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

77,"Barrett esophageal cancer has the fastest growing incidence of any cancer in Western countries. In Asian countries, most cases of esophageal cancer consist of squamous cell carcinomas, not adenocarcinomas. Recently, however, the increase in the number of Barrett esophagus cases with subsequent Barrett cancer has become worrisome in Asian countries, as the number of patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease has been increasing in these countries. In this review, recent reports regarding Barrett esophagus in Asian countries have been collected and this problem is discussed from various perspectives. In Asia, long-segment Barrett esophagus is much less prevalent than in Western countries, whereas short-segment Barrett esophagus is frequently found. In epidemiologic studies, evaluation of the prevalence of Barrett esophagus is limited by poor interob-server diagnostic agreement. Standard criteria for the endoscopic diagnosis of Barrett esophagus in Asian patients, especially of the short-segment type, should be established as soon as possible.

78,"BACKGROUND: The sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) is a plasma membrane glycoprotein that mediates iodide (I-) transport in the thyroid, lactating breast, salivary glands, and stomach. Whereas NIS expression and regulation have been extensively investigated in healthy and neoplastic thyroid and breast tissues, little is known about NIS expression and function along the healthy and diseased gastrointestinal tract. METHODS: Thus, we investigated NIS expression by immunohistochemical analysis in 155 gastrointestinal tissue samples and by immunoblot analysis in 17 gastric tumors from 83 patients. RESULTS: Regarding the healthy Gl tract, we observed NIS expression exclusively in the basolateral region of the gastric mucin-producing epithelial cells. In gastritis, positive NIS staining was observed in these cells both in the presence and absence of Helicobacter pylori. Significantly, NIS expression was absent in gastric cancer, independently of its histological type. Only focal faint NIS expression was detected in the direct vicinity of gastric tumors, i.e., in the histologically intact mucosa, the expression becoming gradually stronger and linear farther away from the tumor. Barrett mucosa with junctional and fundic-type columnar metaplasia displayed positive NIS staining, whereas Barrett mucosa with intestinal metaplasia was negative. NIS staining was also absent in intestinalized gastric polyps. CONCLUSION: That NIS expression is markedly decreased or absent in case of intestinalization or malignant transformation of the gastric mucosa suggests that NIS may prove to be a significant tumor marker in the diagnosis and prognosis of gastric malignancies and also precancerous lesions such as Barrett mucosa, thus extending the medical significance of NIS beyond thyroid disease.",Barrett esophagus,Helicobacter,"Barrett esophagus,Helicobacter","(""Barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett oesophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett ulcer of esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus with esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""ulcerative esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""barretts syndrome""[TIAB]) AND ""Helicobacter""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",17214887,,Expression of the Na+/I- symporter (NIS) is markedly decreased or absent in,BMC cancer,2007/01/12,"['Barrett Esophagus/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*metabolism/pathology', 'Iodine/metabolism', 'Male', 'Metaplasia/metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Symporters/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics']","0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",2007
79,"Gastrointestinal malignancies account for about 20% of all cancers worldwide. It is widely accepted that cancer evolves through several stepwise morphological stages such as the adenoma-carcinoma and hyperplastic polyp-serrated adenoma-carcinoma sequences in colorectal cancers, and the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequences in esophageal and gastric cancers. The morphological progression is associated with the accumulation of multiple genetic and epigenetic events. It is now recognized that epigenetic silencing of gene expression by CpG island methylation is an important alternative mechanism of inactivating tumor suppressor genes. Inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal and pancreaticobiliary tracts and liver such as Barrett esophagus, Helicobacter pylori gastritis, inflammatory bowel disease and viral hepatitis, are associated with increased frequency of malignancies and CpG methylation. In addition, CpG methylation is present in aberrant crypt foci and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia that are considered putative precursors of colon and pancreatic carcinomas, respectively. Understanding of these early genetic and epigenetic changes allows for the discoveries of potential screening, monitoring and therapeutic strategies.

80,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and clinical and endoscopic characteristics of Barrett's esophagus (BE) and the relationship between BE and reflux esophagitis (RE). METHODS: Patients with BE were diagnosed according to new standard by endoscopy and histology. The prevalence, form in endoscopy, histology of biopsy, age, sex, symptom, Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection and relationship between BE and RE were analyzed. RESULTS: BE was 7.90% of the total endoscopy number, and male vs female was 1.98, mean age (45.1 +/- 14.8) years old. Only 19.15% of BE patients had typical reflux symptoms. 81.20% of BE patients were with short segment BE. Intestinal metaplasia was detected in 34.83% of BE and dysplasia 9.88%. 39.94% of BE patients were infected with Hp. Patients with RE (2.07%) were significantly less than those of BE (P < 0.01). 8.42% of BE patients were also with RE and 32.11% of RE patients were also with BE.

83,"CONTEXT: Inlet patch is a congenital anomaly of the cervical esophagus consisting of gastric mucosa. Case reports have documented the histologic type and its associated complications. OBJECTIVE: To report the prevalence and histologic types of inlet patch as well as its association with Barrett esophagus and Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis. DESIGN: We reviewed 1821 consecutive pathology reports from endoscopies of the upper gastrointestinal tract between 1995 and 2002 and identified 20 patients with inlet patch. The patients' ages ranged from 16 to 75 years (mean, 55 years). We examined biopsies from these patients of the cervical esophagus, distal esophagus, and antrum that had been stained with hematoxylin-eosin and the Steiner stain. Biopsies from the cervical esophagus composed of nonoxyntic gastric mucosa were also stained for gastrin-producing cells. RESULTS: In our patient population, inlet patch occurred in 1.1% of all patients in whom an inlet patch had been searched for endoscopically and a biopsy performed. In the inlet patch, oxyntic mucosa was the most common histologic type (11/20), followed by cardiac mucosa (5/20). Four specimens of the inlet patch contained only foveolar epithelium and were therefore considered too superficial to be classified. Twelve of 20 biopsies of the inlet patch were inflamed, and 1 of them was associated with H pylori. Pancreatic acinar tissue was noted in 2 patients; no intestinal metaplasia was found. In the distal esophagus, 4 patients with inlet patch had distal esophagitis, 4 had Barrett esophagus, 5 had oxyntic mucosa, 3 had pancreatic acinar tissue (1 coexisting with oxyntic mucosa), and 5 presented with only unremarkable esophageal squamous mucosa. Antral gastritis was seen in 2 patients, 1 of them with H pylori. The same patient also had H pylori in the inlet patch. CONCLUSION: Inlet patch occurred in about 1% of our study population. Oxyntic mucosa constituted the most common histologic type; inflammation was common. The H pylori infection of the inlet patch correlated with that of the antrum. None of the inlet patch biopsies showed intestinal metaplasia. Pancreatic acinar tissue occurred with similar frequency in the inlet patch and distal esophagus.

84,"BACKGROUND: There are marked local inconsistencies in the Arabian Peninsula about the role of preoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in bariatric surgery. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the frequency of endoscopic and histological findings in the Saudi population presenting for pre-bariatric surgery evaluation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study that included all the patients who were evaluated by EGD at Dammam Medical Complex, Dammam, Saudi Arabia, between 2018 and 2021 as a part of their pre-bariatric-surgery evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 684 patients were included. They consisted of 250 male and 434 female patients (36.5% and 63.5%, respectively). The mean +/- standard deviation for the patients' age and body mass index (BMI) were 36.4+/-10.6 years and 44.6+/-5.1 kg/m(2), respectively. Significant endoscopic or histopathological findings as defined by the presence of large (>/= 2 cm) hiatus hernia, esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett esophagus, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, or intestinal metaplasia were found in 143 patients (20.9%); 364 patients (53.2%) were diagnosed to have Helicobacter pylori infection. CONCLUSION: The high number of significant endoscopic and histopathological findings in our study supports the routine use of preoperative EGD in all bariatric surgery patients. However, omitting EGD before Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in asymptomatic patients is still reasonable as the most frequently found significant findings, esophagitis, and hiatus hernia, are less likely to impact the operative plans in RYGB.

86,"BACKGROUND: Non-oesophageal gastrointestinal eosinophilic diseases (EGID) are considered rare. However, low disease awareness among clinicians and pathologists may contribute to underdiagnosis. AIMS: To determine how frequently requests to evaluate for EGID accompany gastrointestinal biopsies and in what proportion of suspected cases pathologists address these requests, either confirming or refuting the clinical suspicion. METHODS: All cases in which biopsy requisitions included an explicit suspicion of EGID were extracted from a large clinicopathologic database and manually reviewed for accuracy. The diagnoses for these cases were then analysed to determine whether clinical suspicions were confirmed, refuted or ignored. RESULTS: Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) was suspected in 12.8% of 903,516 patients with biopsies and confirmed in 14.9% of them. A suspicion of eosinophilic gastritis accompanied <0.001% of 1,438,206 gastric biopsy sets and was confirmed in 11.5% of them; eosinophilic duodenitis was suspected in 0.02% of ~675,519 patients with duodenal biopsies and confirmed in 8.0% of these; eosinophilic colitis was mentioned in <0.001% of 2,504,485 patients with colonic biopsies and confirmed in 0.1% of them.

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(51): 2040-2046. Summary. Before the 1970s, only 1-3% of esophageal cancers were adenocarcinoma. Since the mid-70s, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has shown the greatest increase compared to all other cancer types and overtook squamous carcinoma incidence in the mid-90s in the Western countries. Today, the relative incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in Hungary is 34.7% and around 60% in the Western countries. Some risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma have been identified such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's esophagus, obesity, smoking and decreased prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection, but these risk factors were already present before the 70s. The prevalence of obesity and the consequentially developed gastroesophageal reflux has doubled during the last 40 years, but it does not explain alone the dramatic rise in the esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence. The H2 blockers, as new effective antisecretory medication, were introduced in 1976, coinciding in time with the substantial rise of esophageal adenocarcinoma. According to the DeMeester theory, the change in the pH of gastric refluxate caused by acid suppression enhances its carcinogenic potential. There are a lot of controversies among the prevention, etiology and treatment of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, especially regarding the long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), an even more effective group of acid suppressors. The effectiveness of PPIs has led to an overuse exceeding its regular indications with little benefit, exposing patients to a number of potential risks. In conclusion, in the dramatic rise of the esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence, obesity accompanied by reflux disease and the decreased incidence of H. pylori infection certainly play important roles. The introduction of modern antisecretory drugs in the treatment of acid-related diseases promoting carcinogenesis, arises as a new consideration.

88,"Routine preoperative endoscopic evaluation for bariatric surgery is controversial; however, for patients undergoing endoscopy, some findings may alter surgical management. Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is found in up to 11.7% of the general population. When associated with determined risk factors, GIM has a risk of progressing to gastric cancer. The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of GIM and possible associated factors in those undergoing bariatric surgery. We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent primary sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at our institution between January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2020. Baseline characteristics and preoperative endoscopic findings were obtained from all patients. Histopathologic analysis of sleeve gastrectomy specimens was reviewed. We identified 753 patients. Mean (SD) age and body mass index were 49.0 (13.1) years and 43.9 (7.1) kg/m(2), respectively. Procedures consisted of 411 (54.6%) gastric bypasses and 342 (45.4%) sleeve gastrectomies.

89,"Chronic acid-biliary reflux and Helicobacter pylori infection are instrumental environmental drivers of cancer initiation and progression in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Remarkably, although these environmental carcinogens are quite dissimilar, the tumour progression cascade these carcinogens engender is highly comparable. For this reason, studies of malignant progression occurring at the anatomic borderland between the oesophagus and the stomach have traditionally lumped junctional adenocarcinomas with either oesophageal adenocarcinoma or gastric adenocarcinoma. Whilst studies have revealed remarkable epidemiological and genetic similarities of these cancers and their associated premalignant conditions, these works have also revealed some key differences.

90,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: A role for Helicobacter pylori in triggering systemic sclerosis (SSc) has been proposed, but data are conflicting. In previous studies, infection has been generally searched for by using serology. We designed this study to assess H. pylori prevalence in SSc patients with histology of gastric mucosa, considered the criterion standard for infection diagnosis. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 30 SSc patients who complained of upper gastrointestinal symptoms. All underwent upper endoscopy with gastric biopsies. Endoscopic alterations were recorded, and gastric mucosa biopsies were used for both histological examination and searching for H. pylori. The role for proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy was considered. Fisher exact test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Data of 28 SSc patients were available, 14 with ongoing PPI therapy. Helicobacter pylori infection at histology was detected in 14.3% patients, and it equally occurred in patients with or without PPI therapy. Erosive esophagitis/Barrett esophagus was detected in 26.6% of cases. Among patients with PPI therapy, 30% received half dose only. The prevalence of intestinal metaplasia was low (14.3%). Endoscopic esophageal alterations were significantly more frequent in those patients showing anti-Scl70 antibody positivity. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that prevalence of H. pylori is very low in SSc patients, so that it seems not having a role in triggering SSc. Management of gastroesophageal diseases in SSc patients needs to be improved, and looking to the autoimmune profile may be of help.

91,"BACKGROUND: Older adults are particularly vulnerable to complications from proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs. We sought to characterize the prevalence of potentially low-value PPI prescriptions among older adults to inform a quality improvement (QI) intervention. METHODS: We created a cohort of patients, aged 65 years or older, receiving primary care at a large academic health system in 2018. We identified patients currently prescribed any PPI using the electronic health record (EHR) medication list (current defined as September 1, 2018). A geriatrician, a gastroenterologist, a QI expert, and two primary care physicians (PCPs) created multidisciplinary PPI appropriateness criteria based on evidenced-based guidelines. Supervised by a gastroenterologist and PCP, two internal medicine residents conducted manual chart reviews in a random sample of 399 patients prescribed PPIs. We considered prescriptions potentially low value if they lacked a guideline-based (1) short-term indication (gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD]/peptic ulcer disease/Helicobacter pylori gastritis/dyspepsia) or (2) long-term (>8 weeks) indication (severe/refractory GERD/erosive esophagitis/Barrett esophagus/esophageal adenocarcinoma/esophageal stricture/high gastrointestinal bleeding risk/Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). We used the Wilson score method to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on low-value PPI prescription prevalence. RESULTS: Among 69 352 older adults, 8729 (12.6%) were prescribed a PPI. In the sample of 399 patients prescribed PPIs, 63.9% were female; their mean age was 76.2 years, and they were seen by 169 PCPs. Of the 399 prescriptions, 143 (35.8%; 95% CI = 31.3%-40.7%) were potentially low value-of which 82% began appropriately (eg, GERD) but then continued long term without a guideline-based indication. Among 169 PCPs, 32 (18.9%) contributed to 59.2% of potentially low-value prescriptions. CONCLUSION: One in eight older adults were prescribed a PPI, and over one-third of prescriptions were potentially low-value. Most often, appropriate short-term prescriptions became potentially low value because they lacked long-term indications. With most potentially low-value prescribing concentrated among a small subset of PCPs, interventions targeting them and/or applying EHR-based automatic stopping rules may protect older adults from harm.

93,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Esophageal motor disorder (EMD) has been shown to be associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, the association of EMD with a Barrett's esophagus (BE) is controversial. Our objective was to evaluate whether the presence of EMD was an independent factor associated with BE. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was conducted in GERD patients who all had oeso-gastroduodenal endoscopy and high-resolution esophageal manometry. The clinical data collected was known or potential risk factors for BE: male gender, smoking and alcohol consumption, age, body mass index, presence of hiatal hernia, frequency, and age of GERD. EMD were classified according to the Chicago classification into: ineffective motor syndrome, fragmented peristalsis and absence of peristalsis, lower esophageal sphincter hypotonia. RESULTS: Two hundred and one patients (101 in the GERD + BE group and 100 in the GERD without BE) were included. In univariate analysis, male gender, alcohol consumption, presence of hiatal hernia, and EMD appeared to be associated with the presence of BE. In a multivariate analysis, 3 independent factors were identified: the presence of EMD (odds ratio [OR], 3.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.71-9.28; P = 0.001), the presence of hiatal hernia (OR, 5.60; 95% CI, 2.45-12.76; P ＜ 0.001), Helicobacter pylori infection (OR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01-0.84; P = 0.035).

95,"Helicobacter pylori is an important human pathogen, associated with a substantial burden from both malignant and non-malignant diseases. The bacterium is classed as a human carcinogen, being strongly linked with gastric cancer, the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide and is also associated with common conditions such as dyspepsia and peptic ulcer. Eradication of H. pylori reduces the incidence of gastric cancer and peptic ulcer, as well as the prevalence and costs of managing dyspepsia. Economic analyses suggest that eradication of H. pylori as a means of controlling gastric cancer is cost-effective in high-risk populations. Even in populations at low risk of gastric cancer, there might be other benefits arising from screening and treatment, owing to the effects on non-malignant upper gastrointestinal diseases. However, public health authorities have been slow to consider the benefits of population-based screening and treatment as a means of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with the infection. There are also concerns about widespread use of eradication therapy, including antimicrobial resistance and a rise in the prevalence of diseases that are negatively associated with H. pylori, such as GERD, Barrett oesophagus, asthma and obesity.

96,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is rapidly increasing in incidence in many Western societies, requires demanding treatment, and is associated with a poor prognosis, therefore preventive measures are highly warranted. To assess the opportunities for prevention, we reviewed the available literature and identified seven main potentially preventive targets. Preventive effects were found on the basis of medium-level observational evidence following treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (using both medication and surgery) and tobacco smoking cessation, which should be clinically recommended among exposed patients. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs appear to prevent EAC, and the limited existing data also indicate a protective effect of medication with statins or hormone replacement therapy in women, but current evidence is insufficient to guide clinical decision-making regarding these drugs. The evidence is presently insufficient to assess the potentially preventive role of weight loss. Whether avoidance of eradication of Helicobacter pylori prevents EAC is not studied, but there is no evidence that such eradication increases symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux or prevalence of erosive esophagitis. The introduction of preventive actions should be tailored toward high-risk individuals, that is, older men with obesity and gastroesophageal reflux disease and individuals with Barrett esophagus rather than the population at large.

97,"Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. These cancers are the end result of a complex interplay between gene and environment. Bacteria, parasites, and viruses have been implicated in some cancers. Recent data have put at focus the gut microbiome as the key player firing tumorigenesis. Experimental and human studies have provided evidence on the role of microbiota in cancer development. Although subject to changes in different settings such as antibiotic treatment, diet or lifestyle, our microbiome is quite stable and is capable of increasing susceptibility to cancer or decrease and halt its progression. The crucial event in carcinogenesis triggered by microbiome seems to be chronic inflammation influencing the genomic stability of host cells and activating immune mechanisms. Infection-related cancers represent 5.5% of the global cancer burden. Chronic inflammation predisposes to cancer in various GI organs, including hepatocellular carcinoma caused by hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus-related chronic hepatitis, gastric cancer (GC) caused by Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis, colorectal cancer caused by inflammatory bowel disease, bile duct cancer by primary sclerosing cholangitis, and esophageal cancer caused by Barrett esophagus.

98,"INTRODUCTION: Given the difficulty in accessing to the excluded stomach after gastric bypass and the increase in gastroesophageal reflux after sleeve gastrectomy, it is justified to perform a preoperative fibrogastroscopy.The influence of the fibrogastroscopy (FGS) findings in the therapeutic approach is analyzed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of preoperative FGS findings is performed, from 04/06 to 12/12. The influence of the FGS results on the surgical technique selection, in the endoscopic or medical treatment and its relation to gastric fistula is analyzed by means of multivariate regression (confounding factors: Age, body mass index, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, antiplatelet therapy, surgical technique (bariatric surgery, sleeve gastrectomy). RESULTS: Three hundred thirty one patients are included: 32.6% biopsy of gastric lesion; 27% gastritis; 18.1% hiatal hernia; 3% metaplasia; 0.6% Barrett esophagus; 2.1% esophagitis; 0.3% dysplasia; 0.3 Schatzky&#180;s ring; 1.5% incompetent cardia; 2.4% duodenitis; 0.3% gastric erosions; 0.6% gastric xanthoma; 1.8%, gastric polyp; 1.6% duodenal ulcer; 0.6% papulo-erosive gastritis; 0.6% esophageal papilloma; 0.3% submucosal tumor.

99,"Common questions that arise regarding treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) include which medications are most effective, when surgery may be indicated, which patients should be screened for Barrett esophagus and Helicobacter pylori infection, and which adverse effects occur with these medications. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective medical therapy, and all PPIs provide similar relief of GERD symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to recommend testing for H. pylori in patients with GERD. In the absence of alarm symptoms, endoscopy is not necessary to make an initial diagnosis of GERD. Patients with alarm symptoms require endoscopy. Screening for Barrett esophagus is not routinely recommended, but may be considered in white men 50 years or older who have had GERD symptoms for at least five years.

100,"The incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma has increased dramatically in the developed world in the last half century. Over approximately the same period there has been an increase in the prevalence of obesity. Multiple epidemiological studies and meta-analyses have confirmed that obesity, especially abdominal, visceral obesity, is a risk factor for gastro-oesophageal reflux, Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Although visceral obesity enhances gastro-oesophageal reflux, the available data also show that visceral obesity increases the risk of Barrett's oesophagus and adenocarcinoma via reflux-independent mechanisms. Several possible mechanisms could link obesity with the risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma in addition to mechanical effects increasing reflux. These include reduced gastric Helicobacter pylori infection, altered intestinal microbiome, factors related to lifestyle, the metabolic syndrome and associated low-grade inflammation induced by obesity and the secretion of mediators by adipocytes which may directly influence the oesophageal epithelium. Of these adipocyte-derived mediators, increased leptin levels have been independently associated with progression to oesophageal adenocarcinoma and in laboratory studies leptin enhances malignant behaviours in cell lines. Adiponectin is also secreted by adipocytes and levels decline with obesity: decreased serum adiponectin levels are associated with malignant progression in Barrett's oesophagus and experimentally adiponectin exerts anticancer effects in Barrett's cell lines and inhibits growth factor signalling. At present there are no proven chemopreventative interventions that may reduce the incidence of obesity-associated oesophageal cancer: observational studies suggest that the combined use of a statin and aspirin or another cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor is associated with a significantly reduced cancer incidence in patients with Barrett's oesophagus.",Barrett esophagus,Helicobacter pylori,"Barrett esophagus,Helicobacter pylori","(""Barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett oesophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett ulcer of esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus with esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""ulcerative esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""barretts syndrome""[TIAB]) AND (""Helicobacter pylori""[TIAB] OR ""Campylobacter pyloridis""[TIAB] OR ""Campylobacter pylori subsp. pylori""[TIAB] OR ""Campylobacter pylori""[TIAB] OR ""Helicobacter nemestrinae""[TIAB]) AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",25364384,10.1177/1756283X14538689,The role of obesity in oesophageal cancer development.,Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology,2014/11/05,,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",2014
101,"Guidelines have been published regarding the management of Barrett's oesophagus (columnar-lined oesophagus). These have examined the role of surveillance in an effort to detect dysplasia and early cancer. The guidelines have provided criteria for enrolment into surveillance and some risk stratification with regard to surveillance interval. The research basis for the decisions reached with regard to cancer risk is weak and this manuscript has examined the available data published from meta-analyses up to 25(th) April 2013 (much of which has been published since the guidelines and their most recent updates have been written). There were 9 meta-analyses comparing patients with Barrett's oesophagus to control populations. These have demonstrated that Barrett's oesophagus is more common in males than females, in subjects who have ever smoked, in subjects with obesity, in subjects with prolonged symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, in subjects who do not have infection with Helicobacter pylori and in subjects with hiatus hernia. These findings should inform public health measures in reducing the risk of Barrett's oesophagus and subsequent surveillance burden and cancer risk. There were 8 meta-analyses comparing different groups of patients with Barrett's oesophagus with regard to cancer risk. These have demonstrated that there was no statistically significant benefit of antireflux surgery over medical therapy, that endoscopic ablative therapy was effective in reducing cancer risk that there was similar cancer risk in patients with Barrett's oesophagus independent of geographic origin, that the adenocarcinoma incidence in males is twice the rate in females, that the cancer risk in long segment disease showed a trend to be higher than in short segment disease, that there was a trend for higher cancer risk in low-grade dysplasia over non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus, that there is a lower risk in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection and that there is a significant protective effect of aspirin and statins. There were no meta-analyses examining the role of intestinal metaplasia. These results demonstrate that guidance regarding surveillance based on the presence of intestinal metaplasia, segment length and the presence of low-grade dysplasia has a weak basis, and further consideration should be given to gender and helicobacter status, ablation of the metaplastic segment as well as the chemoprotective role of aspirin and statins.",Barrett esophagus,Helicobacter pylori,"Barrett esophagus,Helicobacter pylori","(""Barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett oesophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett ulcer of esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus with esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""ulcerative esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""barretts syndrome""[TIAB]) AND (""Helicobacter pylori""[TIAB] OR ""Campylobacter pyloridis""[TIAB] OR ""Campylobacter pylori subsp. pylori""[TIAB] OR ""Campylobacter pylori""[TIAB] OR ""Helicobacter nemestrinae""[TIAB]) AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",25133020,10.4291/wjgp.v5.i3.178,Barrett's oesophagus: Evidence from the current meta-analyses.,World journal of gastrointestinal pathophysiology,2014/08/19,,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",2014
102,"Dong Y, Qi B, Feng XY, Jiang CM. Meta-analysis of Barrett's esophagus in China. World J Gastroenterol 2013;19(46):8770-8779 The disease pattern of Barrett's esophagus (BE) in China is poorly characterised particularly in comparison with other developed countries. This meta-analysis of 3873 cases of BE collated from 69 clinical studies conducted in 25 provinces between 2000 and 2011 investigated the epidemiology and characteristics of BE in China compared to Western countries. The total endoscopic detection rate of BE was 1.0% (95%CI: 0.1%-1.8%) with an average patient age of 49.07 +/- 5.09 years, lower than many Western countries.The authors postulate this may be attributed to environmental risk factor variation, distinct genetics and different medical practice including diagnostic criteria for BE and expertise in endoscopy. This study identified a 1.781 male predominancefor BE in China, consistent with Western reports. Short-segment BE accounted for 80.3% of cases with island type and cardiac type the most common endoscopic (44.8%) and histological (40.0%) manifestations respectively. Of the 1283 BE cases followed up for three to 36 months the incidence of esophageal cancer was 1.418 per 1000 person-years, lower than the incidence reported in Western countries. Lee HS, Jeon SW. Barrett esophagus in Asia: same disease with different pattern. ClinEndosc 2014;47(1):15-22 Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a common, pre-cancerous condition characterised by intestinal metaplasia of squamous esophageal epithelium usually attributed to chronic gastric acid exposure. This review article explores important differences in the disease pattern of BE between Asian and the Western countries. Overall the prevalence of BE is lower in Asia compared to the West with a greater proportion of short-segment type. The authors identify great variability in the endoscopic and pathologic diagnostic criteria for BE. Many of the studies in Asian countries did not use a standardised four-quadrant biopsy protocol which may have led to an underestimation of BE prevalence. The review highlights an increasing incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in the West but unclear disease trend in Asia with inter-country variability. Similarly in Asian and Western countries BE is associated with the presence of hiatus hernia, advancing age, male gender, alcohol consumption, smoking, abdominal obesity and longer duration of gastro-esophageal reflux disease. The authors postulate that Helicobacter pylori infection, more prevalent in Asia than the West, may have a protective effect on BE. There is a need for larger, prospective studies to further clarify the disease pattern of BE in Asian countries. Clearly standardisation of the diagnostic process for BE is important to validate the differences in disease trends between Asian and Western countries. Kiadaliri AA. Gender and social disparities in esophagus cancer incidence in Iran, 2003-2009: a time trend province-level study.Asian Pac J Cancer Prev 2014;15(2):623-7 Esophageal cancer (EC) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality particuarly in Iran where the incidence rate exceeds the global average. An understanding of the factors influencing the province-specific incidence of EC in Iran is important to inform disease-prevention strategies and address health inequalities. This ecological study used cancer registry data to investigate the relationship between gender and social class and the incidence of EC in Iran at province-level between 2003 and 2009. The age standardised incidence rates (ASIR) of EC were greatest in the Northern provinces of Iran, specifically Razavi Khorasan in males and Kordestan in females. Overall the EC incidence did not significantly differ according to gender. Interestingly, during the study period the ASIR increased by 4.6% per year in females (p=0.08) and 6.5% per year in males (p=0.02). This may reflect increasing rates of establised risk factors for EC including obsesity and gastro-esophageal reflux disease alongside more vigilant recording of new cases. Social class was inversely associated with the ASIR of EC regardless of gender which may be attributed to class differences in risk factor distribution particularly smoking, diet and obesity. An appreciation for the limitations of an epidemiological study is important when interpreting results which should be further evaluated in future studies. Islami F et al.Determinants of gastroesophageal reflux disease, including hookah smoking and opium use- A cross-sectional analysis of 50,000 individuals. PLoS One 2014;9(2):e89256 Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a highly prevalent cause of gastrointestinal symptoms worldwide incurring great cost to the primary and secondary healthcare sectors. An improved understanding of the factors which influence GERD symptoms in low- to medium- income countries may inform public health initiatives. This study analysed prospective data from the Golestan cohort study, primarily established to investigate determinants of upper gastrointestinal cancers, toexplore the risk factors influencing GERD symptoms (regurgitation and/or heartburn) in 50,045 individuals aged 40-75 years in Golestan Province, Iran enrolled between 01/2004 and 06/2008.Of note, 39.12% of individuals denied ever experiencing GERD symptoms. A further 19.89% reported at least once weekly GERD symptoms with 11.83% experiencing daily symptoms. Severe symptoms, defined as disturbing daily work or sleep, were recorded by 11.33% of individuals. Separately the occurrence of daily GERD symptoms and severe symptoms were inversely associated with male gender (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.33-0.39 both), level of formal education (p=0.01 and p=0.001 respectively), wealth score (p<0.001 both) and regular nass chewing (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.98 and OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76-0.99 respectively)and were positively associated with body mass index (p<0.001 both), intensity of physical activity (p=0.04 both), cigarette pack years (p<0.001 both), alcohol consumption (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.13-1.64 and OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.28-1.83 respectively) and opium use (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.67-1.99 and OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.55-1.87 respectively).In addition hookah smoking had a borderline significant correlation with mild and moderate severity GERD symptoms in individuals who had never smoked cigarettes (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.00-1.99 and OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.99-1.57 respectively). Overall this large study contributes useful data to inform the prevention and management of GERD symptoms particularly regarding the use of hookah, opium and nass which was previously unclear. Barbera M et al. The human squamous oesophagus has widespread capacity for clonal expansion from cells at diverse stages of differentiation. Gut 2014;0:1-9. doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2013-306171 Current knowledge on human esophageal tissue homeostasis and injury repair is derived predominantly from murine models and hence may be inaccurate due to cellular and architectural differences. This study used 3D imaging in conjunction withstaining for cell lineage markers to investigate the cellular mechanisms involved in homeostasis of the normal human squamous esophagus in 10 participants undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. The self-renewal potential of cell subpopulations was also assessed using in vitro and in vivo assays. A decreasing gradient of cell proliferation was observed from the inter-papillary basal layer to the tip of the papilla where there was no evidence of mitosis. The expression ofbeta1-integrin, a putative stem cell marker, was consistent throughout the basal layer and therefore the entire basal layer can be considered undifferentiated. Quiescent beta1-integrin/CD34-positive cells which failed to stain for CD45, S-100 or F4-80were identified at the tip of the papilla suggesting this is an extension of the basal layer. Contrary to previous data, this study found progenitor cells widely distributed in human esophageal tissue and included already differentiated epithelial cells. This insight into esophageal homeostasis may inform future studies exploring the pathological mechanisms underpinning homeostatic disruption in disease states such as Barrett's esophagus.

103,"Barrett esophagus (BE) is considered to develop as a result of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and to predispose to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). However, the disease pattern of BE in Asia differs from that observed in the West. For example, in the West, the prevalence rates of BE and EAC have progressively increased, whereas although the prevalence rate of GERD is increasing in Asia, the prevalence rates of BE and EAC have remained low in most Asian countries. GERD, hiatal hernia, old age, male sex, abdominal obesity (visceral obesity), smoking, alcohol consumption, and kyphosis are known risk factors for BE in Asia, and most Asian patients have short-segment BE.

104,"Answer questions and earn CME/CNE Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is characterized by 6 striking features: increasing incidence, male predominance, lack of preventive measures, opportunities for early detection, demanding surgical therapy and care, and poor prognosis. Reasons for its rapidly increasing incidence include the rising prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux and obesity, combined with the decreasing prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection. The strong male predominance remains unexplained, but hormonal influence might play an important role. Future prevention might include the treatment of reflux or obesity or chemoprevention with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or statins, but no evidence-based preventive measures are currently available. Likely future developments include endoscopic screening of better defined high-risk groups for EAC. Individuals with Barrett esophagus might benefit from surveillance, at least those with dysplasia, but screening and surveillance strategies need careful evaluation to be feasible and cost-effective. The surgery for EAC is more extensive than virtually any other standard procedure, and postoperative survival, health-related quality of life, and nutrition need to be improved (eg, by improved treatment, better decision-making, and more individually tailored follow-up). Promising clinical developments include increased survival after preoperative chemoradiotherapy, the potentially reduced impact on health-related quality of life after minimally invasive surgery, and the new endoscopic therapies for dysplastic Barrett esophagus or early EAC.

105,"OBJECTIVE: Barrett's esophagus (BO) is a precursor of esophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC), a cancer with a poor prognosis and an increasing incidence. Hence there is an interest in mapping causal factors underlying BO and finding strategies to reduce the risk of dysplasia progression in patients with BO. Here we review current knowledge on established as well as less risk factors for the development of BO. Additionally, we summarize today's status on the use of chemoprevention aiming to reduce the risk of cancer progression in BO patients. METHODS: We searched Medline and the Cochrane Library using the MeSH terms ""Barrett's esophagus"" and ""Barrett esophagus,"" both alone and combined with the terms ""risk factor,"" ""aetiology,"" ""diet,"" or ""prevention."" Focus was on original contributions, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. RESULTS: Established risk factors for the development of BO include gastro-esophageal reflux, obesity, male gender, Caucasian ethnicity, and increasing age. Smoking might increase the risk of BO, while aspirin/NSAIDs, Helicobacter pylori infection, and specific ""healthy"" dietary factors may lower the risk. The potential value of using chemoprevention with proton pump inhibitors, aspirin/NSAIDs, or statins is still uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: There is today a substantial knowledge of risk factors of BO.

106,"AIMS: To compare the clinical and pathological features of gastro-oesophageal junction (GEJ) carcinomas in Chinese and American patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty consecutive patients with a GEJ carcinoma (43 from mainland China, and 37 from the USA) were evaluated for association with Barrett oesophagus (BO), chronic Helicobacter pylori gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and outcome. GEJ carcinomas were defined as tumours that were located within 20 mm of, and crossed, the GEJ. Overall, GEJ carcinomas from Chinese patients revealed significantly more frequent location in the proximal stomach, higher pathological stage, larger size, younger patient age, and association with chronic H. pylori gastritis. In contrast, GEJ cancers from American patients showed a strong association with distal oesophageal location, BO, and associated intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia. Pathologically, GEJ carcinomas from American patients were predominantly adenocarcinomas, whereas Chinese patients showed a higher proportion of mucinous, adenosquamous, acinar or neuroendocrine tumours. Overall, 3- and 5-year survival rates were statistically similar between both patient groups, but upon multivariate analysis, Chinese patients showed statistically better survival rates for stage III tumours.

107,"Ethnic differences in the prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and its complications, including Barrett's oesophagus (BO), are well described in multiracial Asian patient populations. These findings together with familial aggregation of GORD symptoms and twin studies suggest the possibility of a genetic component to GORD. Nevertheless, environmental factors, e.g. Helicobacter pylori infection, abdominal adiposity and metabolic syndrome, could equally account for these differences. Indian (South Asian) race is a risk factor for Barrett' oesophagus. This may be related to the Caucasian genetic make-up of Indians as opposed to an Oriental one as is the case of most other Asians. The HLA-B07 gene commonly found in South Asian and Caucasian populations, but not Orientals, may confer an increased risk for BO. Nevertheless, the high prevalence of H. pylori in South Asians and the consequent atrophic gastritis and hypochlorhydria may partially ameliorate this genetic predisposition to BO. The higher prevalence of obesity and the metabolic syndrome amongst certain Asiatic races may also contribute to the observed increased risk for BO. Future research should target the search for GORD/BO genes, ethnic differences in parietal cell mass and hiatal hernia, H. pylori colonization factors (e.g. MUC1 and MUC2) and adhesion molecules (BabA). Racial differences in lifestyle factors, i.e. abdominal adiposity, consumption of fruit and vegetables as well as smoking, should all be investigated as potential causes for this interethnic variation in GORD and BO.

108,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Rome III criteria has modified the description of functional dyspepsia (FD) and divided this into subgroups. However, the discriminative value of Rome III questionnaire-based diagnosis of FD is yet to be determined. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the Rome III questionnaire for the diagnosis of FD and whether it can discriminate between postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) in patients with dyspeptic symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients, who were not on proton pump inhibitors (PPI), were asked to participate. Patients who have previously established acid peptic disease or predominantly reflux symptoms or having alarm symptoms such as weight loss and hematemesis were excluded. Rome III questionnaire for FD was used to identify the patients as having FD and divide into its subgroups; PDS or EPS. Gastro-duodenal biopsies, liver function tests and ultrasound were done to establish the diagnosis of FD. RESULTS: Out of 272 patients with upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms without alarm features, who were enrolled in the study, a total of 191 (70%) fulfilled the criteria of FD based upon Rome III questionnaire. EPS subgroup was found in 109 (57%), PDS in 17 (9%) patients, overlap between EPS and PDS was present in 56 (29%) patients. Nine (5%) patients remained indeterminate. Diagnosis of FD was established in 136/191 (71%) patients only. Gastritis was present in 116 patients (85%), Duodenitis in 44 (32%) and Helicobacter pylori infection in 70 (51%) patients. Among 55 patients (29%) who had organic diseases, EPS was seen in 35 (64%), PDS in 5 (9%) and overlap in 15 (27%) patients. Underlying organic causes were gastric or duodenal ulcers in 14 patients, Barrett esophagus in five, chronic liver disease in seven, gall stones in five, Giardiasis and celiac disease in three each. Gastric carcinoma, Crohns disease and gastric polyps were seen in one patient each. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that 30% of patients who fulfilled the Rome III criteria for FD actually had organic disease.

109,"The present definition of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is based on clinical criteria that are difficult to reproduce accurately. This study provides a method to develop a histologic definition of GERD based on biopsies obtained from the affected esophagus. Pathology reports from 1655 patients who had upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy according to a systematic protocol were reviewed. Biopsies were obtained from the esophagus, around the gastroesophageal junction and the stomach: proximal, body, and antrum. Patients who had oxyntocardiac+/-cardiac+/-intestinal epithelia between the squamous epithelium proximally and the proximal limit of gastric oxyntic mucosa distally were defined as having a squamo-oxyntic gap. The length of the squamo-oxyntic gap varied from less than 1 cm in 1399 (84.5%) patients to greater than 5 cm in 80 (4.8%) of the patients. Only oxyntocardiac epithelium was seen in 190 (11.5%) of the patients, oxyntocardiac and cardiac epithelia in 898 (54.3%), and intestinal metaplasia in addition to the other 2 epithelial types in 567 (34.2%). The prevalence of intestinal metaplasia was directly proportional to length of the squamo-oxyntic gap, being 24.3% (340/1399) when the length was <1 cm, and 83.5% (147/176) with length 1 to 5 cm. All patients with a length more than 5 cm had intestinal metaplasia. The distribution of the 3 epithelia was constant irrespective of the length of the squamocolumnar gap; intestinal metaplasia, when present, was seen maximally in the proximal region of the gap, cardiac epithelium intermediate and oxyntocardiac epithelium in the most distal segment of the gap. The squamo-oxyntic gap started in a dilated region distal to the end of the tubular esophagus and distal to the proximal limit of the rugal folds and extended into the tubular esophagus. Distal gastric biopsies showed no evidence of significant inflammation, intestinal metaplasia or Helicobacter pylori infection in 1543 (93.2%) of the patients, indicating that the squamo-oxyntic gap was largely independent of gastric pathology. We provide evidence that the squamo-oxyntic gap is equivalent to the columnar-lined esophagus. Its presence is a specific and sensitive indicator of reflux and can be used as a cellular criterion to define GERD.

110,"BACKGROUND: The role of Barrett esophagus in carcinogenesis is widely accepted, but the significance of esophageal columnar mucosa without histological intestinal metaplasia, known as columnar-lined esophagus, is debated. MATERIAL/METHODS: We studied 128 patients free of Helicobacter pylori with reflux-related symptoms and columnar mucosa in the esophagus at endoscopy, 106 patients with Barrett esophagus (referred to as the Barrett group) and 22 patients without intestinal metaplasia (columnar group). Samples from 20 subjects free of H. pylori were used as controls. Immunostaining for keratin 7 (KRT7), keratin 20 (KRT20), caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), mucin 2, oligomeric mucus/gel-forming (MUC2), and tumor protein p53 (TP53) was assessed. RESULTS: Samples taken 1 cm above the gastroesophageal junction showed KRT7 staining in all cases in the Barrett and columnar groups and none in the control group. Immunostaining for TP53 was absent in the control group, and more frequent in the columnar group (7, 31.8%) compared with the Barrett group (14, 13.2%, P=0.033). In the columnar group, low grade dysplasia and TP53 expression was seen in 7 of 22 biopsy specimens (31.8%) at baseline and in 4 additional specimens after 2 years, for a total of 11 specimens (50.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The expression of KRT7 might help to explain the pathological, reflux-related nature of columnar-lined esophagus, as aberrant expression in a very early stage of the multistep Barrett esophagus progression. Expression of KRT7 may occur in basal glandular cells as a result of their multipotentiality and susceptibility to immunophenotype changes induced by reflux.",Barrett esophagus,Helicobacter pylori,"Barrett esophagus,Helicobacter pylori","(""Barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett oesophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett ulcer of esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus with esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""ulcerative esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""barretts syndrome""[TIAB]) AND (""Helicobacter pylori""[TIAB] OR ""Campylobacter pyloridis""[TIAB] OR ""Campylobacter pylori subsp. pylori""[TIAB] OR ""Campylobacter pylori""[TIAB] OR ""Helicobacter nemestrinae""[TIAB]) AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",19396034,,Keratin 7 expression as an early marker of reflux-related columnar mucosa without,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and,2009/04/28,"['Barrett Esophagus/metabolism/microbiology/*pathology', 'Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Esophagogastric Junction/*metabolism/pathology', 'Helicobacter pylori/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Intestines/*pathology', 'Keratin-7/*metabolism', 'Metaplasia']",0 (Biomarkers),['Journal Article'],2009
111,BACKGROUND/AIMS: The purpose of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in gastroesophageal reflux disease is to detect the complications; both Barrett esophagus and erosive esophagitis are common in developed countries. We aimed to investigate the ratio of esophageal complications in gastroesophageal reflux disease and the relationship between reflux symptoms and erosive esophagitis. METHODS: Six hundred forty-five consecutive adult patients presenting to the Reflux Outpatient Clinic were evaluated prospectively. One hundred sixty patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and who complained of heartburn or regurgitation occurring at least weekly were selected. The complaints and general features of patients were queried via a detailed questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (17%) had endoscopic evidence of erosive esophagitis. Barrett esophagus was found in 3 patients (2%). Neither esophageal stricture nor adenocarcinoma was found. Esophagitis was low grade (grades A and B) in 25 of the 27 (92%) with erosive esophagitis. Patients with erosive esophagitis consumed less alcohol than patients with non-erosive reflux disease. No difference was found between the severity of symptoms in patients with erosive esophagitis and non-erosive reflux disease. CONCLUSIONS: Barrett esophagus and erosive esophagitis were less common compared to the literature although the study was conducted in a tertiary reference center for gastroesophageal reflux disease. The presence of severe symptoms in gastroesophageal reflux disease is not an indication for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

112,"Barrett esophageal cancer has the fastest growing incidence of any cancer in Western countries. In Asian countries, most cases of esophageal cancer consist of squamous cell carcinomas, not adenocarcinomas. Recently, however, the increase in the number of Barrett esophagus cases with subsequent Barrett cancer has become worrisome in Asian countries, as the number of patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease has been increasing in these countries. In this review, recent reports regarding Barrett esophagus in Asian countries have been collected and this problem is discussed from various perspectives. In Asia, long-segment Barrett esophagus is much less prevalent than in Western countries, whereas short-segment Barrett esophagus is frequently found. In epidemiologic studies, evaluation of the prevalence of Barrett esophagus is limited by poor interob-server diagnostic agreement. Standard criteria for the endoscopic diagnosis of Barrett esophagus in Asian patients, especially of the short-segment type, should be established as soon as possible. A high prevalence of hiatal hernia and a decreasing prevalence of Helico-bacter pylori infection may increase the number of Barrett esophagus cases and subsequent Barrett cancer in Asian countries in the near future.

113,"BACKGROUND: The sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) is a plasma membrane glycoprotein that mediates iodide (I-) transport in the thyroid, lactating breast, salivary glands, and stomach. Whereas NIS expression and regulation have been extensively investigated in healthy and neoplastic thyroid and breast tissues, little is known about NIS expression and function along the healthy and diseased gastrointestinal tract. METHODS: Thus, we investigated NIS expression by immunohistochemical analysis in 155 gastrointestinal tissue samples and by immunoblot analysis in 17 gastric tumors from 83 patients. RESULTS: Regarding the healthy Gl tract, we observed NIS expression exclusively in the basolateral region of the gastric mucin-producing epithelial cells. In gastritis, positive NIS staining was observed in these cells both in the presence and absence of Helicobacter pylori. Significantly, NIS expression was absent in gastric cancer, independently of its histological type. Only focal faint NIS expression was detected in the direct vicinity of gastric tumors, i.e., in the histologically intact mucosa, the expression becoming gradually stronger and linear farther away from the tumor. Barrett mucosa with junctional and fundic-type columnar metaplasia displayed positive NIS staining, whereas Barrett mucosa with intestinal metaplasia was negative. NIS staining was also absent in intestinalized gastric polyps. CONCLUSION: That NIS expression is markedly decreased or absent in case of intestinalization or malignant transformation of the gastric mucosa suggests that NIS may prove to be a significant tumor marker in the diagnosis and prognosis of gastric malignancies and also precancerous lesions such as Barrett mucosa, thus extending the medical significance of NIS beyond thyroid disease.",Barrett esophagus,Helicobacter pylori,"Barrett esophagus,Helicobacter pylori","(""Barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett oesophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett ulcer of esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus with esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""ulcerative esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""barretts syndrome""[TIAB]) AND (""Helicobacter pylori""[TIAB] OR ""Campylobacter pyloridis""[TIAB] OR ""Campylobacter pylori subsp. pylori""[TIAB] OR ""Campylobacter pylori""[TIAB] OR ""Helicobacter nemestrinae""[TIAB]) AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",17214887,,Expression of the Na+/I- symporter (NIS) is markedly decreased or absent in,BMC cancer,2007/01/12,"['Barrett Esophagus/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*metabolism/pathology', 'Iodine/metabolism', 'Male', 'Metaplasia/metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Symporters/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics']","0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",2007
114,"Gastrointestinal malignancies account for about 20% of all cancers worldwide. It is widely accepted that cancer evolves through several stepwise morphological stages such as the adenoma-carcinoma and hyperplastic polyp-serrated adenoma-carcinoma sequences in colorectal cancers, and the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequences in esophageal and gastric cancers. The morphological progression is associated with the accumulation of multiple genetic and epigenetic events. It is now recognized that epigenetic silencing of gene expression by CpG island methylation is an important alternative mechanism of inactivating tumor suppressor genes. Inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal and pancreaticobiliary tracts and liver such as Barrett esophagus, Helicobacter pylori gastritis, inflammatory bowel disease and viral hepatitis, are associated with increased frequency of malignancies and CpG methylation. In addition, CpG methylation is present in aberrant crypt foci and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia that are considered putative precursors of colon and pancreatic carcinomas, respectively. Understanding of these early genetic and epigenetic changes allows for the discoveries of potential screening, monitoring and therapeutic strategies.

RESULTS: BE was 7.90% of the total endoscopy number, and male vs female was 1.98, mean age (45.1 +/- 14.8) years old. Only 19.15% of BE patients had typical reflux symptoms. 81.20% of BE patients were with short segment BE. Intestinal metaplasia was detected in 34.83% of BE and dysplasia 9.88%. 39.94% of BE patients were infected with Hp. Patients with RE (2.07%) were significantly less than those of BE (P < 0.01). 8.42% of BE patients were also with RE and 32.11% of RE patients were also with BE.

118,"CONTEXT: Inlet patch is a congenital anomaly of the cervical esophagus consisting of gastric mucosa. Case reports have documented the histologic type and its associated complications. OBJECTIVE: To report the prevalence and histologic types of inlet patch as well as its association with Barrett esophagus and Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis. DESIGN: We reviewed 1821 consecutive pathology reports from endoscopies of the upper gastrointestinal tract between 1995 and 2002 and identified 20 patients with inlet patch. The patients' ages ranged from 16 to 75 years (mean, 55 years). We examined biopsies from these patients of the cervical esophagus, distal esophagus, and antrum that had been stained with hematoxylin-eosin and the Steiner stain. Biopsies from the cervical esophagus composed of nonoxyntic gastric mucosa were also stained for gastrin-producing cells. RESULTS: In our patient population, inlet patch occurred in 1.1% of all patients in whom an inlet patch had been searched for endoscopically and a biopsy performed. In the inlet patch, oxyntic mucosa was the most common histologic type (11/20), followed by cardiac mucosa (5/20). Four specimens of the inlet patch contained only foveolar epithelium and were therefore considered too superficial to be classified. Twelve of 20 biopsies of the inlet patch were inflamed, and 1 of them was associated with H pylori. Pancreatic acinar tissue was noted in 2 patients; no intestinal metaplasia was found. In the distal esophagus, 4 patients with inlet patch had distal esophagitis, 4 had Barrett esophagus, 5 had oxyntic mucosa, 3 had pancreatic acinar tissue (1 coexisting with oxyntic mucosa), and 5 presented with only unremarkable esophageal squamous mucosa. Antral gastritis was seen in 2 patients, 1 of them with H pylori. The same patient also had H pylori in the inlet patch. CONCLUSION: Inlet patch occurred in about 1% of our study population. Oxyntic mucosa constituted the most common histologic type; inflammation was common. The H pylori infection of the inlet patch correlated with that of the antrum. None of the inlet patch biopsies showed intestinal metaplasia. Pancreatic acinar tissue occurred with similar frequency in the inlet patch and distal esophagus.

119,"Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. These cancers are the end result of a complex interplay between gene and environment. Bacteria, parasites, and viruses have been implicated in some cancers. Recent data have put at focus the gut microbiome as the key player firing tumorigenesis. Experimental and human studies have provided evidence on the role of microbiota in cancer development. Although subject to changes in different settings such as antibiotic treatment, diet or lifestyle, our microbiome is quite stable and is capable of increasing susceptibility to cancer or decrease and halt its progression. The crucial event in carcinogenesis triggered by microbiome seems to be chronic inflammation influencing the genomic stability of host cells and activating immune mechanisms. Infection-related cancers represent 5.5% of the global cancer burden. Chronic inflammation predisposes to cancer in various GI organs, including hepatocellular carcinoma caused by hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus-related chronic hepatitis, gastric cancer (GC) caused by Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis, colorectal cancer caused by inflammatory bowel disease, bile duct cancer by primary sclerosing cholangitis, and esophageal cancer caused by Barrett esophagus.

120,"INTRODUCTION: The incidence of Esophageal strictures following esophagitis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients is profound in majority of cases. Although endoscopic dilatation remains the first line of treatment, surgery is needed for non-dilatable strictures. Sparse literature is available on clinical management for surgical intervention. PRESNTATION OF THE CASE: A 30 years old HIV positive male, taking ART for 10 years, presented with grade V dysphagia over long standing non-specific ulcerative esophagitis. Upper GI endoscopy revealed a long stricture starting 18 cm from the incisors. The patient underwent multiple endoscopic dilatation along with twice endoscopic stent placements over period of 2 years. As CD4 count was low associated with poor nutritional status a feeding jejunostomy was constructed. With improvement in CD4 count and nutritional status within 3 months; thoracoscopic esophagectomy, laparotomy and formation of gastric conduit and cervical anastomosis was performed. There were no intraoperative or postoperative adverse events with complete improvement in dysphagia. During follow up, 24 months after surgery the patient was on full oral diet with a total weight gain of 15 kg. DISCUSSION: Long term solution to dysphagia due to long esophageal stricture merits a surgery in form of a replacement conduit by either stomach tube or a segment of colon. Experience and literature guiding surgical decision making are limited. Retaining or excision of the native oesophagus is still a matter of discussion.

121,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the absorption of four antiretroviral agents-raltegravir, etravirine, emtricitabine, and tenofovir-is compromised when administered by gastrostomy tube. DESIGN: Pharmacokinetic analysis. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENT: A 52-year-old African-American man coinfected with advanced multidrug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and chronic hepatitis B, who was receiving treatment with raltegravir, etravirine, emtricitabine, and tenofovir, and developed ulcerative esophagitis with perforation, requiring a gastrostomy tube. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Due to the patient's esophageal perforations, all nutrition and drug therapy had to be provided by gastrostomy tube. As his antiretroviral regimen of raltegravir, etravirine, and emtricitabine-tenofovir was not available in liquid or powder formulations, the oral tablets were crushed or dispersed and mixed with water, then administered by gastrostomy tube. To ensure that the absorption of the drugs was sufficient for antiretroviral response, plasma samples were collected at 2 hours and 12 hours after dosing, and drug concentrations were quantitated by using validated assays. The 2- and 12-hour postdose plasma concentrations were 1220 and 446 ng/ml for raltegravir, 212 and 274 ng/ml for etravirine, 1148 and 164 ng/ml for emtricitabine, and 320 and 94 ng/ml for tenofovir, respectively. The patient's plasma concentrations were then compared with those in published pharmacokinetic studies of oral regimens administered to HIV-infected persons and healthy volunteers. Overall, the plasma concentrations of the antiretrovirals administered by gastrostomy tube were similar to published values. No drug toxicities were observed in this patient. CONCLUSION: These pharmacokinetic data suggest that absorption of raltegravir, etravirine, emtricitabine, and tenofovir was not compromised when the drugs were administered by gastrostomy tube. These findings provide a basis for further investigation of the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerance, and antiretroviral response to raltegravir, etravirine, and emtricitabine-tenofovir when the oral route of administration is not possible.",Barrett esophagus,Human immunodeficiency virus,"Barrett esophagus,Human immunodeficiency virus","(""Barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett oesophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett ulcer of esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus with esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""ulcerative esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""barretts syndrome""[TIAB]) AND ""Human immunodeficiency virus""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",22392423,10.1002/PHAR.1015,Acceptable plasma concentrations of raltegravir and etravirine when administered,Pharmacotherapy,2012/03/07,"['Drug Interactions/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*physiology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', '*Gastrostomy', 'HIV Infections/*blood/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitriles', 'Pyridazines/administration & dosage/*blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines', 'Pyrrolidinones/administration & dosage/*blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Raltegravir Potassium']",0 (Nitriles),"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",2012
122,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The best method(s) for the diagnosis of esophageal ulcers in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is unknown. METHODS: Over an 8-year period, all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with a CD4 lymphocyte count of < or =250/mm(3) and an esophageal ulcer underwent a standard protocol consisting of 2 biopsy examinations for viral culture (shell vial technique), brushing for cytology with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for viral antigens, and 10 biopsy examinations of the ulcer base/edge for routine histology and IHC. The cause of ulcer was based on histologic findings and clinical and endoscopic follow-up evaluation after therapy. RESULTS: Forty patients with 48 episodes of ulcer were studied (mean age, 34 yr; 88% men; median CD4 lymphocyte count = 31 cells/mm(3); range, 0-250 cells/mm(3)). Six patients had more than one endoscopic examination documenting ulcer, and 2 patients had more than one cause of ulcer. The most common causes of ulcer were: idiopathic (IEU) 22, cytomegalovirus (CMV) 15, and gastroesophageal reflux disease 6. Viral culture was positive for herpes simplex in 3 of 3, but only 4 of 15 (27%) for CMV, and specificity of viral culture was 100%. Cytologic brushings were only positive in the patients with herpes simplex virus (HSV) or incidental Candida esophagitis. Viral cytopathic effect was apparent on routine histologic staining in each patient with viral esophagitis, and IHC confirmed the diagnosis in each patient.

123,"Esophageal cancer is a relatively common malignancy worldwide with a high mortality (5-year survival of <15%). Despite screening, surveillance, improved imaging and treatment, the exponential rise in OAC continues. The strongest risk factors for OAC are chronic heartburn and metaplastic transformation of the lower third of the esophagus (Barrett's esophagus). The risk profile includes Caucasian race, male gender older age, obesity and smoking. Although the tumor risk in BO has been progressively revised downwards, the exponential rise in OAC remains unchecked. This paradox points to an unidentified missing link. Relatively recently, we provided the world's initial data for a strong association of biologically relevant hr-HPV with BD and OAC. Since then, systematic reviews and meta-analysis have documented HPV DNA prevalence rates in OAC of between 13 to 35%. In this review, we provide some evidence for a probable causal relationship between hr-HPV and OAC. This is challenging given the multifactorial etiology and long latency. Increasingly, high-risk HPV (hr-HPV) is regarded as a risk factor for OAC.

124,"Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of proteins that have received considerable attention over the last several years. They have been classified into six prominent families: high-molecular-mass HSP, 90, 70, 60, 40, and small heat shock proteins. HSPs participate in protein folding, stability, and maturation of several proteins during stress, such as in heat, oxidative stress, fever, and inflammation. Due to the immunogenic host's role in the combat against cancer cells and the role of the inflammation in the cancer control or progression, abnormal expression of these proteins has been associated with many types of cancer, including esophagogastric cancer. This study aims to review all the evidence concerning the role of HSPs in the pathogenesis and prognosis of esophagogastric cancer and their potential role in future treatment options. This narrative review gathers scientific evidence concerning HSPs in relation to esophagus and gastric cancer. All esophagogastric cancer subtypes are included. The role of HSPs in carcinogenesis, prognostication, and therapy for esophagogastric cancer are discussed. The main topics covered are premalignant conditions for gastric cancer atrophic gastritis, Barrett esophagus, and some viral infections such as human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

129,"BACKGROUND: Esophageal granular cell tumor (eGCT) is rare, and the recent literature suggests a link between eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and eGCT. The aim of our study was to determine if EoE or other disorders associated with eosinophilia are consistently associated with eGCT. METHODS: We retrospectively searched pathology databases of three academic institutions from 1999 to 2018 for eGCTs. The archived slides and medical records were reviewed. RESULTS: From 294,855 esophagogastroduodenoscopy procedures, 45 patients (17 males and 28 females) with eGCTs were identified. The patients (30-73 years in age, median 50) had eGCT 0.2-2.0 cm in size (average 0.71). Thirteen had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, 5 had Barrett esophagus/goblet cell metaplasia and 1 had EoE. Thirty-four eGCTs had intralesional eosinophils (14 with peak > 10 eosinophils/400x hpf); of these, 21 also had eosinophils in lamina propria (9 with peak > 10 eosinophils/hpf). eGCT with atypical features (including nuclear enlargement and prominent nucleoli) were more likely to have increased eosinophils in non-epithelial compartments than those without atypia. Pleomorphism and spindled cells were seen in 3 eGCT cases (mean peak intralesional eosinophils: 43 per hpf); 2 of these had goblet cell metaplasia. We found no association between EoE and eGCT, p = 0.5966, (95% C.I. 0.0276, 6.5389, Fisher's exact test). Instead, most patients had gastroesophageal reflux disease or Barrett esophagus.

RESULTS: MSGCs were identified in 22 cases (6%: 7 gastric, 15 GEJ). Patients' average age was 53 years. There was no sex predilection. 77% cases had only 1 or 2 MSGCs per 10 high power fields. MSGCs were located in the lamina propria of the gastric or GEJ mucosa, with an accentuation in the subepithelial zone. The median number of nuclei in a MSGC was 5 (ranging from 3 to 16).

132,"CONTEXT: Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) based on 2-photon excitation fluorescence and second-harmonic generation allows simultaneous visualization of cellular details and extracellular matrix components of fresh, unfixed, and unstained tissue. Portable multiphoton microscopes, which could be placed in endoscopy suites, and multiphoton endomicroscopes are in development, but their clinical utility is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine fresh, unfixed endoscopic biopsies obtained from the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction to (1) define the MPM characteristics of normal esophageal squamous mucosa and gastric columnar mucosa, and (2) evaluate whether diagnosis of intestinal metaplasia/Barrett esophagus (BE) could be made reliably with MPM. DESIGN: The study examined 35 untreated, fresh biopsy specimens from 25 patients who underwent routine upper endoscopy. A Zeiss LSM 710 Duo microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, New York) coupled to a Spectra-Physics (Mountain View, California) Tsunami Ti:sapphire laser was used to obtain a MPM image within 4 hours of fresh specimen collection. After obtaining MPM images, the biopsy specimens were placed in 10% buffered formalin and submitted for routine histopathologic examination. Then, the MPM images were compared with the findings in the hematoxylin-eosin-stained, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections. The MPM characteristics of the squamous, gastric-type columnar and intestinal-type columnar epithelium were analyzed. In biopsies with discrepancy between MPM imaging and hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections, the entire tissue block was serially sectioned and reevaluated. A diagnosis of BE was made when endoscopic and histologic criteria were satisfied. RESULTS: Based on effective 2-photon excitation fluorescence of cellular reduced pyridine nucleotides and flavin adenine dinucleotide and lack of 2-photon excitation fluorescence of mucin and cellular nuclei, MPM could readily identify and distinguish among squamous epithelial cells, goblet cells, gastric foveolar-type mucous cells, and parietal cells in the area of gastroesophageal junction. Based on the cell types identified, the mucosa was defined as squamous, columnar gastric type (cardia/fundic-type), and metaplastic columnar intestinal-type/BE. Various types of mucosa seen in the study of 35 biopsies included normal squamous mucosa only (n = 14; 40%), gastric cardia-type mucosa only (n = 2; 6%), gastric fundic mucosa (n = 6; 17%), and both squamous and gastric mucosa (n = 13; 37%). Intestinal metaplasia was identified by the presence of goblet cells in 10 of 25 cases (40%) leading to a diagnosis of BE on MPM imaging and only in 7 cases (28%) by histopathology. In 3 of 35 biopsies (9%), clear-cut goblet cells were seen by MPM imaging but not by histopathology, even after the entire tissue block was sectioned. Based on effective 2-photon excitation fluorescence of elastin and second-harmonic generation of collagen, connective tissue in the lamina propria and the basement membrane was also visualized with MPM. CONCLUSIONS: Multiphoton microscopy has the ability to accurately distinguish squamous epithelium and different cellular elements of the columnar mucosa obtained from biopsies around the gastroesophageal junction, including goblet cells that are important for the diagnosis of BE. Thus, use of MPM in the endoscopy suite might provide immediate microscopic images during endoscopy, improving screening and surveillance of patients with BE.",Barrett esophagus,Lamina,"Barrett esophagus,Lamina","(""Barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett oesophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett ulcer of esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus with esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""ulcerative esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""barretts syndrome""[TIAB]) AND ""Lamina""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",24476518,10.5858/arpa.2012-0675-OA,Evaluation of Barrett esophagus by multiphoton microscopy.,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,2014/01/31,"['Adenine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Barrett Esophagus/*diagnosis/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Biopsy', 'Cardia/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Connecticut', 'Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal', 'Esophagogastric Junction/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Esophagus/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Gastric Fundus/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Gastric Mucosa/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Goblet Cells/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Lasers', 'Materials Testing', 'Metaplasia', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence, Multiphoton/instrumentation', 'Mucous Membrane/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', '*Point-of-Care Systems', 'Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared']",0 (Adenine Nucleotides),"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",2014

METHODS: From January 1983 to January 2011, 164 patients underwent esophagectomy alone for intramucosal adenocarcinoma. Cancers were subdivided by depth of invasion: lamina propria 50 (30%) and muscularis mucosa 114 (70%; inner 42 [26%], middle 16 [10%], and outer 56 [34%]). We assessed complications and esophagectomy-related mortality (safety) and cancer recurrence (effectiveness), and identified determinants of long-term outcomes. RESULTS: Barrett esophagus (P = .005), larger cancers (P < .001), worse histologic grade (P < .001), lymphovascular invasion (P < .001), and overstaging (P = .02) were associated with deeper cancers. One patient had regional lymph node metastases (0.6%). Seventy-five patients (46%) had complications. Seven of 9 deaths within 6 months were esophagectomy related, 6 from respiratory failure. Seven patients had recurrence, all within 4 years. Five-, 10-, and 15-year survivals were 82%, 69%, and 60%, respectively, which were similar to those of a matched general population. Determinants of late mortality were older age (P = .004), poorer lung function (P < .0001), longer cancer (P = .04), postoperative pneumonia (P = .06), cancer recurrence (P < .0001), and second cancers (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Survival after esophagectomy for intramucosal adenocarcinoma is excellent, determined more by patient than cancer characteristics. Patient selection and respiratory function are crucial to minimize harm. Considering the outcome of emerging therapies, esophagectomy should be reserved for patients with a long intramucosal adenocarcinoma or those in whom endoscopic therapies fail or are inappropriate.",Barrett esophagus,Lamina,"Barrett esophagus,Lamina","(""Barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett oesophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett ulcer of esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus with esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""ulcerative esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""barretts syndrome""[TIAB]) AND ""Lamina""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",23158254,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2012.10.027,Intramucosal esophageal adenocarcinoma: primum non nocere.,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2012/11/20,"['Adenocarcinoma/mortality/pathology/*surgery', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Barrett Esophagus/complications', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/*surgery', '*Esophagectomy/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Respiratory Function Tests', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",2012
134,"Distinguishing Barrett esophagus with high-grade dysplasia (BE-HGD) from intramucosal and submucosal adenocarcinomas on biopsies is challenging, yet important, in the choice of therapy. The current study evaluates preresection biopsies from patients who underwent esophagectomy for at least BE-HGD, to compare the recently published histologic categories by the University of Michigan (UM) and Cleveland Clinic (CC), correlate preresection and final resection diagnosis, and identify histologic features in biopsies that might be predictive of adenocarcinoma on esophagectomy. A total of 112 cases with a consensus biopsy diagnosis (agreement by >/=4 of 7 gastrointestinal pathologists) were statistically analyzed to identify histologic features that predicted adenocarcinoma on resection. Applying the UM criteria to the biopsy series showed excellent agreement with the CC system (kappa=0.86) and significant correlation between preoperative and esophagectomy diagnoses (P<0.001).

135,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the depth of invasion within the mucosal compartment, with particular attention to the duplicated muscularis mucosae, and survival after esophagectomy performed as treatment for Barrett esophagus-related superficial adenocarcinoma. METHODS: A total of 185 patients with pT1 esophageal adenocarcinoma treated by esophagectomy without induction therapy were identified. Depth of invasion was subdivided into invasion into the lamina propria (LP), into the inner muscularis mucosae, between the inner and outer muscularis mucosae, and into the outer muscularis mucosae (OMM), with comparison with tumors invading the inner one third of the submucosa (SM-1). Patient and tumor characteristics were compared among the 5 groups using the chi test or the Kruskal-Wallis test. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The prognostic effect of depth of invasion on survival was assessed with Cox proportional hazards analysis. RESULTS: Depth of invasion was LP (n=68), inner muscularis mucosae (n=38), BMM (n=11), OMM (n=33), and SM-1 (n=35). There was no significant difference in sex or age among groups. One of 150 patients with intramucosal adenocarcinoma (0.7%; LP, pN2) and 3 of 35 patients with SM-1 (8.6%; all pN1) had nodal disease. There were no significant differences in survival among the groups.

136,"BACKGROUND: The muscularis mucosa underlying the metaplastic mucosa of Barrett esophagus is frequently duplicated, with an intervening layer of lamina propria between the superficial or neomuscularis mucosa (NMM) and the deep/true muscularis mucosa (TMM). This duplication causes difficulties with accurate staging of superficially invasive carcinoma in biopsy specimens and endoscopic mucosal resections (EMRs), as invasion underneath the superficial muscle layers may be mistaken for submucosal invasion. Mucosal resections or other ablative nonsurgical therapies can be curative in patients with esophageal intramucosal carcinoma, whereas patients with submucosal invasion are recommended for esophagectomy. Therefore, the accurate staging of such specimens is crucial. Smoothelin is a novel smooth muscle protein expressed only by fully differentiated smooth muscle cells and not by proliferative or noncontractile smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. It has been suggested that in the bladder, immunohistochemistry for smoothelin may help separate hyperplastic muscularis mucosa from the true muscularis propria. We hypothesized that in the esophagus, immunohistochemistry for smoothelin would differentiate the NMM from the TMM. DESIGN: Thirty cases of EMRs for Barrett esophagus-related neoplasia were retrieved from the archives of the pathology department, St Michael's Hospital. Immunohistochemical staining for smoothelin was performed to evaluate differential staining in the TMM versus NMM. Fifteen cases were stained for smooth muscle actin and smooth muscle myosin. The staining score was evaluated on a scale from 0 to 3 according to the percentage and intensity of staining. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining results for smoothelin were as follows: the NMM showed weak focal staining (+1) in 23 of 30 cases (82%), and moderate staining (+2) in 7 of 30 cases (12%), and the TMM showed very strong and diffuse staining (+3) in 30 of 30 cases. No cases showed negative (0) staining in the NMM. With smooth muscle actin and myosin, strong and diffuse staining was observed with similar intensity in both the TMM and NMM in 15 of 15 cases. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, smoothelin staining in the NMM is significantly weaker than that seen in the true/deep muscularis mucosa. This pattern is similar to that reported for the muscularis mucosae of the urinary bladder. Although smoothelin can readily distinguish the 2 layers, its value might be limited by the need to simultaneously compare the 2 layers. Although this might be of use in EMR specimens in which both layers are visible, use in biopsies may be limited as the residual staining in the NMM may inhibit definitive evaluation. This issue may be resolved by the use of appropriate standard controls, individual optimization of the antibody, and the use of an automated digital assessment.",Barrett esophagus,Lamina,"Barrett esophagus,Lamina","(""Barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett oesophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett ulcer of esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus with esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""ulcerative esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""barretts syndrome""[TIAB]) AND ""Lamina""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",21164287,10.1097/PAS.0b013e3182035fb6,Immunohistochemical staining for smoothelin in the duplicated versus the true,The American journal of surgical pathology,2010/12/18,"['Actins/analysis', 'Adenocarcinoma/*chemistry/pathology', 'Barrett Esophagus/*metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*analysis', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/*chemistry/pathology', 'Esophagus/*chemistry/pathology', 'Humans', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Metaplasia', 'Mucous Membrane/chemistry/pathology', 'Muscle Proteins/*analysis', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Ontario', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Smooth Muscle Myosins/analysis']",0 (Actins),['Journal Article'],2010
137,"BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are associated with high rates of complete eradication of Barrett esophagus (BE). However, if ablation were to induce fibrosis in the regenerated squamous epithelium, then postablation biopsies may not penetrate deeply enough to detect subsquamous intestinal metaplasia (SSIM) and, therefore, complete response rates could be over-estimated. GOALS: To assess the depth of esophageal biopsies from the squamous epithelium of ablation-naive controls and from the neosquamous epithelium of post-PDT and post-RFA patients to determine if prior ablation results in a reduced proportion of biopsies containing lamina propria (LP) as compared with controls. STUDY: Review of archived esophageal specimens from a prospective multicenter cohort study (post-RFA) and 2 retrospective consecutive case series (ablation-naive controls, post-PDT). SETTING: Eight US centers and 1 US gastrointestinal pathology laboratory. PATIENTS: Ablation-naive controls with GERD, dyspepsia, and/or BE. Post-PDT and post-RFA BE patients with biopsies more than 6 months after achieving complete eradication of BE. INTERVENTIONS: Review of endoscopic biopsies from ablation-naive controls, post-PDT patients, and post-RFA patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: One GI pathology lab processed all tissue and slides. One expert GI pathologist, blinded to cohort, graded the depth of each esophageal specimen as: partial epithelium, full epithelium, LP, muscularis mucosae, or submucosa. Each specimen was also evaluated for SSIM. RESULTS: There were 82 patients [ablation-naive (12), post-PDT (10), post-RFA (60)] with 899 biopsy specimens. The proportion of specimens containing ""LP or deeper"" was similar between groups: ablation-naive (88%), post-PDT (88%), post-RFA (91%) (P>0.05). No SSIM was detected in any group. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in esophageal biopsy depth between ablation-naive squamous epithelium and post-PDT/post-RFA neo-squamous epithelium, thus refuting the concern of ablation-induced mucosal resistance to procurement of adequate biopsy specimens. Most biopsies (88% to 91%) from both ablation cohorts were deep enough to detect SSIM, in that they included ""LP or deeper.""",Barrett esophagus,Lamina,"Barrett esophagus,Lamina","(""Barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett oesophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett ulcer of esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus with esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""ulcerative esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""barretts syndrome""[TIAB]) AND ""Lamina""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",20485185,10.1097/MCG.0b013e3181dadaf1,Does ablative therapy for Barrett esophagus affect the depth of subsequent,Journal of clinical gastroenterology,2010/05/21,"['Aged', 'Barrett Esophagus/pathology/*therapy', 'Biopsy', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Catheter Ablation/adverse effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Electrocoagulation/adverse effects', '*Esophagoscopy', 'Esophagus/pathology/*surgery', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Metaplasia', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucous Membrane/pathology/surgery', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', '*Photochemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States']",,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",2010

Seventy-five GI biopsies (9 esophageal, 15 gastric, 16 duodenal, 5 ileal, 30 colonic) from 46 transplant recipients from 2002 to 2006 were obtained and assessed for multiple histologic features. Clinical features were recorded for all cases and endoscopic findings. Only MMF patients showed ulcerative esophagitis (5/7 cases) and reactive gastropathy (4/10 cases). Only MMF patients showed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-like features in duodenal (4/12 cases) and ileal (1/5 cases) biopsies.

139,"A well-known type of mesenchymal/epithelial interaction occurs in Barrett esophagus (BE) characterized by the formation of a new, superficially located, muscularis mucosae (MM), which results in the division of the lamina propria (LP) into a superficial and deep compartment. The vascular and lymphatic properties of these 2 regions of LP are unknown. The risk of metastases of carcinomas that infiltrate these 2 anatomic areas also remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the density of blood vessels and lymphatic spaces within the superficial and deep LP and submucosa in patients with BE, and to compare the results to normal squamous-lined esophagus. Thirty esophago-gastrectomy specimens were stained immunohistochemically with CD31 (stains blood vessel and lymphatic endothelium) and D2-40 (stains lymphatic endothelium only). The density of CD31+ blood and lymphatic vessels (per 20 x field) in BE (superficial LP=37 and deep LP=38) was significantly lower compared with the LP of squamous-lined esophagus (68; P<0.001). However, the total number of blood and lymphatic vessels in the superficial and deep LP in BE was statistically similar to the LP of squamous-lined esophagus. The density of CD31+ blood and lymphatic vessels (per 20x field) in the submucosa of BE (21) was not significantly different from the submucosa of squamous-lined esophagus (23; P>0.05). We conclude that in BE, the ""native"" LP in squamous-lined esophagus is separated into 2 LP compartments (superficial and deep) by the formation of a new MM. These findings suggest that carcinomas that invade through the superficial MM into the deep LP should be considered ""intramucosal"" rather than ""submucosal.""

140,"Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is increasingly used for management of Barrett esophagus (BE)-related neoplasia. Duplication of the muscularis mucosae (MM) has been described in BE esophagectomy specimens, where it can pose difficulties with accurate staging of carcinoma. The frequency, morphologic characteristics, and effect of MM duplication in adenocarcinoma staging in EMRs have not yet been evaluated. We studied 122 EMR specimens from 100 patients from 1999 to 2006. The following histologic features were scored: depth of EMR, presence of MM duplication and its extent, prolapse changes (extension of smooth muscle into lamina propria), gland entrapment, and diagnosis (original and study/final). Carcinomas reaching the level of submucosa were classified as invasive adenocarcinoma (INV); those confined to lamina propria or MM were classified as intramucosal adenocarcinoma (IMAC). Of 122 EMRs, 11 (9%) reached mucosa only, 109 (89%) extended to submucosa, and 2 (2%) extended into muscularis propria. MM duplication was present in 67% (75 of 111 specimens that reached at least submucosa). Prolapse changes were noted in 65 (54%) cases and gland entrapment in 67 (56%). Final pathologic diagnoses were 9 (7%) no specialized Barrett mucosa, 4 (3%) BE without dysplasia, 13 (11%) low-grade dysplasia, 51 (42%) high-grade dysplasia, 33 (27%) IMAC, and 12 (10%) INV. EMRs without BE were less likely to show MM duplication (P = 0.01) and there was a trend toward less frequent prolapse change (P = 0.08) and less gland entrapment (P = 0.08) as compared with EMRs with BE. However, there were no significant differences with respect to MM duplication, prolapse change, or gland entrapment between BE with or without dysplasia, IMAC, or INV. Among 33 cases of IMAC, tumor invaded lamina propria in 10 (30%), inner or single MM in 14 (42%), space between duplicated MM in 5 (15%), and outer MM layer in 4(12%). Lymphatic invasion was seen in 2 (10%) cases in which tumor reached the space between MM layers. Overstaging of carcinomas occurred in the original reports in 8 (7%) cases due to misinterpretation of the muscular anatomy, including one case in which the deep MM was interpreted as muscularis propria. These results show that MM duplication is commonly seen in EMR specimens. It is closely associated with the presence of BE but is not affected by neoplastic progression in the Barrett epithelium. Pathologists need to be aware of this distinctive anatomy of BE for accurate staging of adenocarcinomas, particularly to avoid mistaking a thickened outer MM as muscularis propria. Level of IMAC may be a critical feature because of potential access to lymphatic spaces between duplicated MM layers, and we therefore recommend including an explicit statement about the depth of adenocarcinoma invasion rather than using only broad terms such as IMAC or INV in the diagnostic report.",Barrett esophagus,Lamina,"Barrett esophagus,Lamina","(""Barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett oesophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett ulcer of esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus with esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""ulcerative esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""barretts syndrome""[TIAB]) AND ""Lamina""[TIAB] AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",18300796,10.1097/PAS.0b013e31815bf8c7,Muscularis mucosae duplication and the musculo-fibrous anomaly in endoscopic,The American journal of surgical pathology,2008/02/28,"['Adenocarcinoma/*pathology/surgery', 'Barrett Esophagus/*pathology/surgery', 'Diagnostic Errors/*prevention & control', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery', 'Esophagectomy/*methods', '*Esophagoscopy', 'Esophagus/*pathology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Mucous Membrane/pathology/surgery', 'Muscle, Smooth/pathology/surgery', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precancerous Conditions/*pathology/surgery']",,['Journal Article'],2008
141,"Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of proteins that have received considerable attention over the last several years. They have been classified into six prominent families: high-molecular-mass HSP, 90, 70, 60, 40, and small heat shock proteins. HSPs participate in protein folding, stability, and maturation of several proteins during stress, such as in heat, oxidative stress, fever, and inflammation. Due to the immunogenic host's role in the combat against cancer cells and the role of the inflammation in the cancer control or progression, abnormal expression of these proteins has been associated with many types of cancer, including esophagogastric cancer. This study aims to review all the evidence concerning the role of HSPs in the pathogenesis and prognosis of esophagogastric cancer and their potential role in future treatment options. This narrative review gathers scientific evidence concerning HSPs in relation to esophagus and gastric cancer. All esophagogastric cancer subtypes are included. The role of HSPs in carcinogenesis, prognostication, and therapy for esophagogastric cancer are discussed.

142,"Microsatellite instability (MSI) has been reported in various tumors, with colon cancer as the prototype. However, little is known about MSI in Barrett esophagus (BE)-associated adenocarcinoma. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the clinicopathologic and molecular features of BE-associated adenocarcinomas with and without MSI. The study cohort consisted of 76 patients with BE-associated adenocarcinomas (66 male, 10 female), with a mean age of 65.1 years. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and CD3 and in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA were performed. MLH1 and PMS2 expression was lost by IHC in 5 cases (6.6%); of these, 5 showed high-level MSI (MSI-H) by polymerase chain reaction assay, and 4 showed hMLH1 promoter methylation. Histologically, tumors with MSI-H were heterogenous and included conventional adenocarcinomas with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (n=1), medullary carcinoma (n=2), signet ring cells (n=1), and signet ring cell and mucinous components (n=1). Compared with tumors negative for MSI by IHC, BE-associated adenocarcinomas with MSI-H were associated with older patient age (P=0.0060), lymphovascular invasion (P=0.027), and significantly larger numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (P<0.0001).

144,"Esophageal cancer is a relatively common malignancy worldwide with a high mortality (5-year survival of <15%). Despite screening, surveillance, improved imaging and treatment, the exponential rise in OAC continues. The strongest risk factors for OAC are chronic heartburn and metaplastic transformation of the lower third of the esophagus (Barrett's esophagus). The risk profile includes Caucasian race, male gender older age, obesity and smoking. Although the tumor risk in BO has been progressively revised downwards, the exponential rise in OAC remains unchecked. This paradox points to an unidentified missing link. Relatively recently, we provided the world's initial data for a strong association of biologically relevant hr-HPV with BD and OAC. Since then, systematic reviews and meta-analysis have documented HPV DNA prevalence rates in OAC of between 13 to 35%. In this review, we provide some evidence for a probable causal relationship between hr-HPV and OAC. This is challenging given the multifactorial etiology and long latency. Increasingly, high-risk HPV (hr-HPV) is regarded as a risk factor for OAC.

145,"Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of proteins that have received considerable attention over the last several years. They have been classified into six prominent families: high-molecular-mass HSP, 90, 70, 60, 40, and small heat shock proteins. HSPs participate in protein folding, stability, and maturation of several proteins during stress, such as in heat, oxidative stress, fever, and inflammation. Due to the immunogenic host's role in the combat against cancer cells and the role of the inflammation in the cancer control or progression, abnormal expression of these proteins has been associated with many types of cancer, including esophagogastric cancer. This study aims to review all the evidence concerning the role of HSPs in the pathogenesis and prognosis of esophagogastric cancer and their potential role in future treatment options. This narrative review gathers scientific evidence concerning HSPs in relation to esophagus and gastric cancer. All esophagogastric cancer subtypes are included. The role of HSPs in carcinogenesis, prognostication, and therapy for esophagogastric cancer are discussed. The main topics covered are premalignant conditions for gastric cancer atrophic gastritis, Barrett esophagus, and some viral infections such as human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

155,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The best method(s) for the diagnosis of esophageal ulcers in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is unknown. METHODS: Over an 8-year period, all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with a CD4 lymphocyte count of < or =250/mm(3) and an esophageal ulcer underwent a standard protocol consisting of 2 biopsy examinations for viral culture (shell vial technique), brushing for cytology with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for viral antigens, and 10 biopsy examinations of the ulcer base/edge for routine histology and IHC. The cause of ulcer was based on histologic findings and clinical and endoscopic follow-up evaluation after therapy. RESULTS: Forty patients with 48 episodes of ulcer were studied (mean age, 34 yr; 88% men; median CD4 lymphocyte count = 31 cells/mm(3); range, 0-250 cells/mm(3)). Six patients had more than one endoscopic examination documenting ulcer, and 2 patients had more than one cause of ulcer. The most common causes of ulcer were: idiopathic (IEU) 22, cytomegalovirus (CMV) 15, and gastroesophageal reflux disease 6. Viral culture was positive for herpes simplex in 3 of 3, but only 4 of 15 (27%) for CMV, and specificity of viral culture was 100%. Cytologic brushings were only positive in the patients with herpes simplex virus (HSV) or incidental Candida esophagitis. Viral cytopathic effect was apparent on routine histologic staining in each patient with viral esophagitis, and IHC confirmed the diagnosis in each patient.

156,"INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: The outcomes of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in the esophagus have not been assessed in our country. Our primary aim was to analyze the effectiveness and safety of the technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analysis of the prospectively maintained national registry of ESD. We included all superficial esophageal lesions removed by ESD in 17 hospitals (20 endoscopists) between January 2016 and December 2021. Subepithelial lesions were excluded. The primary outcome was curative resection. We conducted a survival analysis and used logistic regression analysis to assess predictors of non-curative resection. RESULTS: A total of 102 ESD were performed on 96 patients. The technical success rate was 100% and the percentage of en-bloc resection was 98%. The percentage of R0 and curative resection was 77.5% (n=79; 95%CI: 68%-84%) and 63.7% (n=65; 95%CI: 54%-72%), respectively. The most frequent histology was Barrett-related neoplasia (n=55 [53.9%]). The main reason for non-curative resection was deep submucosal invasion (n=25). The centers with a lower volume of ESD obtained worse results in terms of curative resection.

157,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Patients with Barrett's esophagus are at increased risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic therapies aim to eradicate dysplastic and metaplastic tissues. Hybrid argon plasma coagulation (hybrid-APC) utilizes submucosal fluid injection to create a protective cushion prior to ablation that shields the submucosa from injury. We performed a pooled meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hybrid-APC. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of major electronic databases in April 2022. Studies that included patients with dysplastic and non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus undergoing treatment with hybrid-APC were eligible for inclusion. Outcome measures included complete remission of intestinal metaplasia (CR-IM), stricture formation, serious adverse events, and number of sessions necessary to achieve CR-IM. RESULTS: Overall pooled CR-IM rate for patients undergoing hybrid-APC was 90.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.872-0.939; I2=0%). Pooled stricture rate was 2.0% (95% CI, 0.005-0.042; I2=0%). Overall serious adverse event rate was 2.7% (95% CI, 0.007-0.055; I2=0%). CONCLUSION: Results of the current meta-analysis suggest that hybrid-APC is associated with high rates of CR-IM and a favorable safety profile.

160,"BACKGROUND: The progression of Barrett's esophagus (BE) to early esophageal carcinoma occurs sequentially; the metaplastic epithelium develops from a low-grade dysplasia to a high-grade dysplasia (HGD), resulting in early esophageal carcinoma and, eventually, invasive carcinoma. Endoscopic approaches including resection and ablation can be used in the treatment of this condition. AIM: To compare the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) vs endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) + RFA in the endoscopic treatment of HGD and intramucosal carcinoma. METHODS: In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review included studies comparing the two endoscopic techniques (EMR + RFA and RFA alone) in the treatment of HGD and intramucosal carcinoma in patients with BE. Our analysis included studies involving adult patients of any age with BE with HGD or intramucosal carcinoma. The studies compared RFA and EMR + RFA methods were included regardless of randomization status. RESULTS: The seven studies included in this review represent a total of 1950 patients, with 742 in the EMR + RFA group and 1208 in the RFA alone group. The use of EMR + RFA was significantly more effective in the treatment of HGD [RD 0.35 (0.15, 0.56)] than was the use of RFA alone. The evaluated complications (stenosis, bleeding, and thoracic pain) were not significantly different between the two groups.

161,"AIM: To evaluate the ability of PillCamColon2 to visualize colonic segments missed by incomplete optical colonoscopy (OC) and to assess the diagnostic yield. METHODS: This prospective multicentre study included 81 patients from nine centres who underwent second-generation colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) following incomplete OC performed by an experienced gastroenterologist (> 1000 colonoscopies). Patients with stenosis were excluded. According to patient preferences, CCE was performed the following day (protocol A) after staying on clear liquids and 0.75 L Moviprep in the morning or within 30 d after new split-dose Moviprep (protocol B). Boosts consisted of 0.75 L and 0.25 L Moviprep, and phospho-soda was given as a rescue if the capsule was not excreted after seven hours. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were analysed (51% of them in group A; 49% in group B). Bowel cleansing was adequate in 67% of cases, and CCE could visualize colonic segments missed by incomplete colonoscopy in 90% of patients under protocol A and 97% of patients under protocol B (P = 0.35, n.s.). Significant polyps including adenocarcinoma were detected in 24% of cases. Detection rates for all polyps and significant polyps per patient were similar in both protocols. Polyps were found predominantly in the right colon (86%) in segments that were not reached by OC. Extracolonic findings - such as reflux esophagitis, suspected Barrett esophagus, upper GI-bleeding, gastric polyps, gastric erosions and angiectasia - were detected in eight patients. PillCamColon2 capsule was retained in the ileum of one patient (1.4%) without symptoms and removed during an uneventful resection for unknown Crohn's disease that was diagnosed as the cause of anemia, which was the indication for colonoscopy.

162,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the prognosis of patients with esophageal cancer after non-curative endoscopic resection (ER) followed by esophagectomy (ER + S) with that of patients after primary surgery (PS). METHODS: Between 2000 and 2015, 287 patients had esophagectomy for T1 esophageal cancer. 81 of these patients underwent at least one ER in curative intention before surgery (7 squamous cell carcinomas, 74 adenocarcinomas). Indications for esophagectomy were R1-resection, submucosal infiltration, multifocality, long-segment Barrett esophagus, recurrence, postinterventional stenosis or a combination of these factors. Using propensity-score matching with gender, age, year of diagnosis, tumor localization, mucosal/submucosal infiltration and histology, the clinicopathologic and survival data of these patients were compared to those of 81 patients after PS (median follow-up: 5.5 years). RESULTS: There were no significant differences between both groups concerning number of resected lymph nodes and percentage of nodal metastasis (9.3% total). 9% of esophagectomy specimens after ER showed pT2/pT3-tumors. The 5-year survival rate was 86% in the PS and 85% in the ER + S group (p = 0.498). The disease-free survival was 85% in patients with ER + S and 98% in PS (p < 0.005). The recurrence rate after esophagectomy was higher after ER + S compared to PS (p = 0.015). More than 3 months time delay between ER and surgery was associated with reduced survival, but only within the first postinterventional year.

A 68-year-old female was admitted for odynophagia which had developed several days before. Upper endoscopy revealed extensive ulceration covered by whitish exudates with submucosal edema at the proximal esophagus. She was treated with steroids and empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics. Within 14 days the symptoms improved. Since growth of B-hemolytic Streptococcus was detected in nasal smear culture, bacterial esophagitis was suspected. Gram staining was carried out on the already obtained tissue that had been fixed with formalin. There was heavy infiltration with gram-positive cocci morphologically consistent with Streptococcus.

AIMS: To evaluate the efficiency of endotherapy in the case of neoplastic BE relapse after successful complete endoscopic eradication of neoplastic BE and metaplastic BE. METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records was collected in a computerized and prospective manner between 2000 and 2015, in a single tertiary care center. Recurrence was defined by histological presence of high-grade dysplasia or superficial adenocarcinoma at least 6 months after the end of successful initial endotherapy. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were assessed (1F/17 M). Delay between initial treatment and relapse was 16.6 months (range 6-33). Endotherapy for relapse obtained a sustained and complete remission for 8/18 (44%) patients, with an average endoscopic follow-up of 28 months. The complication rate of endotherapy was 6%. Surgical management was required in 33% (2 pT2N0M0, 2 pTisN0M0, 1 pTm2N0M0 and 1 pTm3N0M0) and salvage radiochemotherapy in 17% (3/18). One patient treated by 6 sessions of ER was considered as a failure given the multiple sessions of endotherapy.

SEC, due to their limited metastatic potential, are amenable to non-invasive treatment modalities. Endoscopic ultrasound, endoscopic mucosal resection, and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) are some of the new modalities that gastroenterologists have used over the last decade to diagnose and treat SEC. However, esophageal stricture (ES) is a very common complication and a major cause of morbidity post-ESD. In the past few years, there has been a tremendous effort to reduce the incidence of ES among patients undergoing ESD. Steroids have shown the most consistent results over time with minimal complications although the preferred mode of delivery is debatable, with both systemic and local therapy having pros and cons for specific subgroups of patients.

There is some evidence that suggests considerable long-term morbidity, partly because of dysphagia, which has been reported in up to 85% of adult patients who undergo surgery for esophageal atresia. The authors hypothesized that dysphagia in this population is caused by dysmotility and⁄or anatomical anomalies. OBJECTIVE: To determine the motor and anatomical causes of dysphagia. METHODS: A total of 41 adults, followed at the Esophageal Atresia Clinic at Hopital Saint-Luc (Montreal, Quebec), were approached to particpate in the present prospective study. Evaluation was completed using upper endoscopy, manometry and barium swallow for the participants who consented. The medical charts of respondents were systematically reviewed from the neonatal period to 18 years of age to assess medical and surgical history. RESULTS: All 41 patients followed at the clinic consented and were included in the study. Dysphagia was present in 73% of patients. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed in 32 patients: hiatal hernia was present in 62% (n=20); esophageal diverticulum in 13% (n=4); macroscopic Barrett esophagus in 31% (n=10); and esophagitis in 19% (n=6). Histological esophagitis was present in 20% and intestinal metaplasia in 10%. There were no cases of dysplagia or adenocarcinoma. Esophageal manometry was performed on 56% of the patients (n=23). Manometry revealed hypomotility in 100% of patients and included an insufficient number of peristaltic waves in 96%, nonpropagating peristalsis in 78% and low-wave amplitude in 95%. Complete aperistalsis was present in 78%. The lower esophageal sphincter was abnormal in 12 (52%) patients, with incomplete relaxation the most common anomaly. Of the 41 patients, 29 (71%) consented to a barium swallow, which was abnormal in 13 (45%). The anomalies found were short esophageal dilation in 28%, delay in esophageal emptying in 14%, diverticula in 14% and stenosis in 7% of patients. There was more than one anomaly in 14% of patients. CONCLUSION: Dysphagia was a highly prevalent symptom in adults who underwent surgery for esophageal atresia.

168,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Stricture formation is a common complication after endoscopic mucosal resection. Predictors of stricture formation have not been well studied. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational, descriptive study by using a prospective endoscopic mucosal resection database in a tertiary referral center. For each patient, we extracted the age, sex, lesion size, use of ablative therapy, and detection of esophageal strictures. The primary outcome was the presence of esophageal stricture at follow-up. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the association between the primary outcome and predictors. RESULTS: Of 136 patients, 27% (n=37) had esophageal strictures. Thirty-two percent (n=44) needed endoscopic dilation to relieve dysphagia (median, 2; range, 1 to 8). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the size of the lesion excised is associated with increased odds of having a stricture (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.3; p=0.01), when controlling for age, sex, and ablative modalities. Similarly, the number of lesions removed in the index procedure was associated with increased odds of developing a stricture (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 4.2; p=0.007).

There is no consensus on whether to routinely perform esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) before endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). Currently, practice patterns are variable and prospective data are needed. AIM: : To determine the proportion of clinically meaningful lesions detected when EGD is performed routinely before EUS. STUDY: This was a multicenter prospective cohort study conducted at tertiary referral center and large community practice. Patients undergoing EUS for pancreatico-biliary and mediastinal indications were enrolled. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful lesion found on EGD. This was a combined outcome defined as any lesion that would alter medical management, or impact the subsequent EUS examination. RESULTS: Two hundred four patients were included in the final analysis. Clinically meaningful lesions were found on EGD in 45 patients [22.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 16.4-27.8].

172,"CONTEXT: The surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease is indicated in patients with a chronic condition when proton pump inhibitors therapy is ineffective or when symptoms are persistently recurrent. Fundoplication failure occurrence has been detected in some patients and highlights a needing of monitoring esophageal post-surgical condition since that clinical symptoms are not sensitive enough for indicating fundoplication failure. AIMS: To identify the frequency of a disrupted wrap in the postoperative period and to evaluate esophageal complications related with gastroesophageal reflux recurrence in children and adolescents. METHODS: The study was cross-sectional, prospective and descriptive, including 45 patients (16 months-16.9 years) who had undergone Nissen fundoplication in a school hospital. Twenty six patients (57.8%) were neurologically impaired. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed in order to determine fundoplication integrity, endoscopic and histopathological esophageal condition. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed from 12 up to 30 months after surgery. RESULTS: Patent wrap was identified in 41 patients (91.1%). Recurrent peptic esophagitis was found in 6 of 45 patients, 2 of which required a second fundoplication and other two had Barrett esophagus. Endoscopic peptic esophagitis was associated with a defective wrap (P = 0.005).

173,"AIM: To analyze the correlation between the failure of medical treatment in patients with reflux esophagitis or Barrett esophagus and LES function, manometrically measured. METHODOLOGY: This is a prospective study of 24 patients admitted in our clinic for reflux disease symptoms, who were investigated by endoscopy (combined with biopsy), esophageal manometry and 24 h pH monitoring. The including criteria for the patients was abnormal esophageal exposure to acid reflux, each patient having abnormal 24 h pH monitoring (pH < 4 in the esophagus more then 4.4% in 24 h). Each patient received medical treatment with clinic and endoscopic reevaluation after 3 months. RESULTS: From the 24 patients that were included: 4 patients having Barrett esophagus, 13 patients with esophagitis (3 patients associated complications such as ulcer or esophageal stenosis) and 7 patients without visible lesions on endoscopy. From the 24 patients, 11 patients presented an incompetent LES, characterized by the following values obtained by manometry: total length < or = 2 cm, abdominal length < or = 1 cm, mean pressure: < 6 mmHg. There were 2 patients from the 4 having Barrett esophagus that presented an incompetent LES, and also the 3 patients having esophagitis associated with complications. All patients were reevaluated clinically and endoscopically after 3 months of medical treatment with PPI 40 mg/day. From the 11 patients with incompetent LES, 5 patients had symptoms or modifications on endoscopy, whereas from 13 patients with a competent LES only one patient presented with symptoms of reflux disease.

176,"OBJECTIVE: Current endoscopic mucosal resection techniques are suboptimal for large circumferential mucosal resections intended to treat Barrett mucosa with multicentric foci of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia or early adenocarcinomas. A rigid modified endoscope was developed for extended endoscopic mucosal resection in the esophagus. This pilot animal study investigated the feasibility of circumferential endoscopic mucosal resections of different lengths in the sheep esophagus. METHODS: Circumferential esophageal endoscopic mucosal resections of 2.2 cm (n = 6), 3.3 cm (n = 6), 4.4 cm (n = 7), and 5.5 cm (n = 5) were performed in 24 sheep. Circumferential resections consisted of two opposite hemicircumferential mucosectomies. Animals were followed up with endoscopic examinations at 1 week and then monthly to 6 months, or until complete re-epithelialization without stenosis eventually ensued. Strictures were treated with a single or repeated dilatations with Savary bougies. RESULTS: Circumferential resections 2.2 to 5.5 cm in length were successfully performed in 23 of 24 of the animals. One perforation occurred directly after mucosectomy. Accurate depth of resection through the submucosa was obtained in 85% of the specimens. Cicatricial stenosis was controlled in 95% by bougienage. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic mucosal resection performed with the rigid esophagoscope allowed extensive circumferential resections in a single session.

184,"Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. These cancers are the end result of a complex interplay between gene and environment. Bacteria, parasites, and viruses have been implicated in some cancers. Recent data have put at focus the gut microbiome as the key player firing tumorigenesis. Experimental and human studies have provided evidence on the role of microbiota in cancer development. Although subject to changes in different settings such as antibiotic treatment, diet or lifestyle, our microbiome is quite stable and is capable of increasing susceptibility to cancer or decrease and halt its progression. The crucial event in carcinogenesis triggered by microbiome seems to be chronic inflammation influencing the genomic stability of host cells and activating immune mechanisms. Infection-related cancers represent 5.5% of the global cancer burden. Chronic inflammation predisposes to cancer in various GI organs, including hepatocellular carcinoma caused by hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus-related chronic hepatitis, gastric cancer (GC) caused by Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis, colorectal cancer caused by inflammatory bowel disease, bile duct cancer by primary sclerosing cholangitis, and esophageal cancer caused by Barrett esophagus. Apart from its impact in GI cancer development microbiota can also play an important role in the progression of cancer, response to chemotherapy or cancer prevention.

185,"With the development of culture-independent technique, a complex microbiome has been established and described in the distal esophagus. The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has increased dramatically in the United States. Studies documenting an altered microbiome associated with EAC and its precedents suggest that dysbiosis may be contributing to carcinogenesis, potentially mediated by interactions with toll-like receptors. Investigations attempting to associate viruses with EAC have not been as consistent. Currently available data are cross-sectional and therefore cannot prove causal relationships.

186,"Helicobacter pylori is an important human pathogen, associated with a substantial burden from both malignant and non-malignant diseases. The bacterium is classed as a human carcinogen, being strongly linked with gastric cancer, the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide and is also associated with common conditions such as dyspepsia and peptic ulcer. Eradication of H. pylori reduces the incidence of gastric cancer and peptic ulcer, as well as the prevalence and costs of managing dyspepsia. Economic analyses suggest that eradication of H. pylori as a means of controlling gastric cancer is cost-effective in high-risk populations. Even in populations at low risk of gastric cancer, there might be other benefits arising from screening and treatment, owing to the effects on non-malignant upper gastrointestinal diseases. However, public health authorities have been slow to consider the benefits of population-based screening and treatment as a means of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with the infection. There are also concerns about widespread use of eradication therapy, including antimicrobial resistance and a rise in the prevalence of diseases that are negatively associated with H. pylori, such as GERD, Barrett oesophagus, asthma and obesity.

187,"Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of proteins that have received considerable attention over the last several years. They have been classified into six prominent families: high-molecular-mass HSP, 90, 70, 60, 40, and small heat shock proteins. HSPs participate in protein folding, stability, and maturation of several proteins during stress, such as in heat, oxidative stress, fever, and inflammation. Due to the immunogenic host's role in the combat against cancer cells and the role of the inflammation in the cancer control or progression, abnormal expression of these proteins has been associated with many types of cancer, including esophagogastric cancer. This study aims to review all the evidence concerning the role of HSPs in the pathogenesis and prognosis of esophagogastric cancer and their potential role in future treatment options. This narrative review gathers scientific evidence concerning HSPs in relation to esophagus and gastric cancer. All esophagogastric cancer subtypes are included. The role of HSPs in carcinogenesis, prognostication, and therapy for esophagogastric cancer are discussed. The main topics covered are premalignant conditions for gastric cancer atrophic gastritis, Barrett esophagus, and some viral infections such as human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

188,"Microsatellite instability (MSI) has been reported in various tumors, with colon cancer as the prototype. However, little is known about MSI in Barrett esophagus (BE)-associated adenocarcinoma. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the clinicopathologic and molecular features of BE-associated adenocarcinomas with and without MSI. The study cohort consisted of 76 patients with BE-associated adenocarcinomas (66 male, 10 female), with a mean age of 65.1 years. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and CD3 and in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA were performed. MLH1 and PMS2 expression was lost by IHC in 5 cases (6.6%); of these, 5 showed high-level MSI (MSI-H) by polymerase chain reaction assay, and 4 showed hMLH1 promoter methylation. Histologically, tumors with MSI-H were heterogenous and included conventional adenocarcinomas with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (n=1), medullary carcinoma (n=2), signet ring cells (n=1), and signet ring cell and mucinous components (n=1). Compared with tumors negative for MSI by IHC, BE-associated adenocarcinomas with MSI-H were associated with older patient age (P=0.0060), lymphovascular invasion (P=0.027), and significantly larger numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (P<0.0001). However, there was no statistical difference in overall survival between the 2 groups (P=0.285). In conclusion, MSI-H is uncommon in BE-associated adenocarcinomas, but is associated with clinicopathologic features fairly similar to sporadic microsatellite unstable colorectal cancers. Given the growing evidence that indicates lack of benefits from adjuvant therapy with fluorouracil in the colonic counterpart, it may be important to identify MSI-H in BE-associated adenocarcinomas.",Barrett esophagus,human gammaherpesvirus 4,"Barrett esophagus,human gammaherpesvirus 4","(""Barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett oesophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett ulcer of esophagus""[TIAB] OR ""barrett esophagus with esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""ulcerative esophagitis""[TIAB] OR ""barretts syndrome""[TIAB]) AND (""human gammaherpesvirus 4""[TIAB] OR ""Epstein Barr virus""[TIAB] OR ""Epstein-Barr virus""[TIAB] OR ""Human herpesvirus type 4""[TIAB] OR ""Human herpesvirus 4""[TIAB] OR ""Epstein-Barr virus EBV""[TIAB]) AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",21422910,10.1097/PAS.0b013e31820f18a2,Clinicopathologic and molecular profiles of microsatellite unstable Barrett,The American journal of surgical pathology,2011/03/23,"['Adenocarcinoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Aged', 'Barrett Esophagus/complications/genetics/*pathology', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/pathology', 'Male', '*Microsatellite Instability', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,['Journal Article'],2011
189,"Baylisascaris procyonis, or raccoon roundworm, is a rare cause of eosinophilic meningoencephalitis with historically poor clinical outcomes. Symptoms of neural larval migrans begin approximately 2-4 weeks after ingestion with fatigue, nausea, fever, and lethargy and then rapidly progress to weakness, incoordination, ataxia, seizures, altered mental status, and finally coma. Only 31 other cases of CNS Baylisascaris neural larval migrans have been reported, with more than 25% being lethal. Of the remaining cases, all but 3 were neurologically devastated largely because of delays in diagnosis and treatment. We present a case of an infant with Baylisascaris neural larval migrans manifested as right hemiparesis, ataxia, and cortical blindness. Eosinophilia was missed at an outside hospital due to misidentification of eosinophils as monocytes on automated cell differential. Repeated testing of serum and CSF revealed marked eosinophilia consistent with eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, and serum antibody testing through the Centers of Disease Control confirmed Baylisascaris infection. Notably, this child had a remarkably positive outcome with near complete recovery of neurologic function after treatment with albendazole and steroids. Although eosinophilic meningoencephalitis is rare, accounting for less than 3% of all lumbar punctures with pleocytosis, this case illustrates (1) the importance of early disease recognition and treatment to improve patient outcomes and (2) the fact that automated cell differentials may misidentify eosinophils as monocytes.",Baylisascaris infection,Baylisascaris procyonis,"Baylisascaris infection,Baylisascaris procyonis","""Baylisascaris infection""[TIAB] AND (""Baylisascaris procyonis""[TIAB] OR ""raccoon roundworm""[TIAB]) AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",36028321,10.1212/WNL.0000000000201233,"Clinical Reasoning: A 12-Month-Old Male Child With Staring Episodes, Ataxia, and",Neurology,2022/08/27,"['Animals', 'Male', 'Clinical Reasoning', '*Ascaridoidea', 'Raccoons', '*Meningoencephalitis/diagnosis', 'Ataxia/complications', '*Eosinophilia/complications/diagnosis', 'Paresis/complications']",,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",2022
190,"We report a remarkably good outcome in a 14-month-old boy with early clinical diagnosis and aggressive empirical treatment of neural larva migrans caused by the raccoon roundworm Baylisascaris procyonis. He presented with fever, meningismus, lethargy, irritability and asymmetric spastic extremity weakness. Early findings of marked blood and cerebrospinal fluid eosinophilia and of diffuse white matter signal abnormality in the brain and spinal cord on MRI suggested a parasitic encephalomyelitis. Rapid presumptive treatment with albendazole and high-dose steroids halted progression of clinical signs. The diagnosis was confirmed by 2 sequential enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies positive for B procyonis serum immunoglobulin G and by Western blot. Field examination with soil sampling yielded infective Baylisascaris eggs. Repeat MRI 3 months later showed atrophy and diffuse, chronic white matter abnormalities, discordant with the marked clinical improvement in this interval. At 10 months, residual neurologic deficits included subtle paraparesis and moderate language delay. This case is the first in which spinal involvement in human Baylisascaris infection was clinically suspected and confirmed by neuroimaging. Importantly, early diagnosis and aggressive treatment of Baylisascaris meningo-encephalitis and myelitis with albendazole and high-dose steroids likely contributed to the good outcome in this patient, in contrast with previous reports.",Baylisascaris infection,Baylisascaris procyonis,"Baylisascaris infection,Baylisascaris procyonis","""Baylisascaris infection""[TIAB] AND (""Baylisascaris procyonis""[TIAB] OR ""raccoon roundworm""[TIAB]) AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",22311989,10.1542/peds.2011-2078,Good outcome with early empiric treatment of neural larva migrans due to,Pediatrics,2012/02/09,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Albendazole/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Ascaridida Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Ascaridoidea/drug effects/*parasitology', 'Central Nervous System Helminthiasis/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Larva Migrans/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Raccoons/parasitology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Treatment Outcome']",0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones),"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",2012
191,"Large ascarid larvae within granulomas were noted histologically in the mesenteric and pancreatic lymph nodes of 13 of 21 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) euthanized as part of an experimental viral pathogenesis study. In addition, 7 of the 13 monkeys had cerebral granulomas, which in 4 animals contained nematode larvae similar to those within the lymph nodes. Despite the lesions, the animals did not show clinical signs associated with the parasitic infections. Characteristics of the larvae included, on cross-section, a midbody diameter of approximately 60 to 80 mum, a centrally located and slightly compressed intestine flanked on either side by large triangular excretory columns, and prominent single lateral cuticular alae. The morphology of the larvae was compatible with Baylisascaris spp. Baylisascariasis is a well-described infection of animals and humans that is caused by migrating larvae of the raccoon roundworm, Baylisascaris procyonis. A similar species, B. columnaris, is found in skunks and can cause cerebrospinal nematodiasis, but most reported cases of baylisascariasis have been due to B. procyonis. Our macaques were born free-ranging on an island in the southeastern United States where raccoons, but not skunks, were found to be common inhabitants, indicating that B. procyonis was the most likely parasite involved. These cases are similar to the low-level or covert cases of Baylisascaris infection described to occur in humans and provide further evidence of the existence of this parasite in the southeastern United States.",Baylisascaris infection,Baylisascaris procyonis,"Baylisascaris infection,Baylisascaris procyonis","""Baylisascaris infection""[TIAB] AND (""Baylisascaris procyonis""[TIAB] OR ""raccoon roundworm""[TIAB]) AND fha[FILT] AND (""2004""[Date - Publication] : ""2024/02/29""[Date - Publication])",18702454,,Visceral and neural larva migrans in rhesus macaques.,Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science : JAALAS,2008/08/16,"['Animals', 'Ascaridoidea/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Brain/parasitology/pathology', 'Larva Migrans/pathology/*veterinary', 'Lymph Nodes/parasitology/pathology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Mesentery/parasitology', 'Monkey Diseases/*parasitology/pathology', 'Parasitic Diseases, Animal/*parasitology/pathology']",,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",2008
